## 2. Getting Started

If you are getting started with Spring Boot, or “Spring” in general, start by reading this section. It answers the basic “what?”, “how?” and “why?” questions. It includes an introduction to Spring Boot, along with installation instructions. We then walk you through building your first Spring Boot application, discussing some core principles as we go.

### 2.1. Introducing Spring Boot

Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using `java -jar` or more traditional war deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs “spring scripts”.

Our primary goals are:

- Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.
- Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

### 2.2. System Requirements

Spring Boot 2.2.9.RELEASE requires [Java 8](https://www.java.com/) and is compatible up to Java 14 (included). [Spring Framework 5.2.8.RELEASE](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/) or above is also required.

Explicit build support is provided for the following build tools:

| Build Tool | Version                                                      |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maven      | 3.3+                                                         |
| Gradle     | 5.x and 6.x (4.10 is also supported but in a deprecated form) |

#### 2.2.1. Servlet Containers

Spring Boot supports the following embedded servlet containers:

| Name         | Servlet Version |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| Tomcat 9.0   | 4.0             |
| Jetty 9.4    | 3.1             |
| Undertow 2.0 | 4.0             |

You can also deploy Spring Boot applications to any Servlet 3.1+ compatible container.

### 2.3. Installing Spring Boot

Spring Boot can be used with “classic” Java development tools or installed as a command line tool. Either way, you need [Java SDK v1.8](https://www.java.com/) or higher. Before you begin, you should check your current Java installation by using the following command:

```
$ java -version
```

If you are new to Java development or if you want to experiment with Spring Boot, you might want to try the [Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli) (Command Line Interface) first. Otherwise, read on for “classic” installation instructions.

#### 2.3.1. Installation Instructions for the Java Developer

You can use Spring Boot in the same way as any standard Java library. To do so, include the appropriate `spring-boot-*.jar` files on your classpath. Spring Boot does not require any special tools integration, so you can use any IDE or text editor. Also, there is nothing special about a Spring Boot application, so you can run and debug a Spring Boot application as you would any other Java program.

Although you *could* copy Spring Boot jars, we generally recommend that you use a build tool that supports dependency management (such as Maven or Gradle).

##### Maven Installation

Spring Boot is compatible with Apache Maven 3.3 or above. If you do not already have Maven installed, you can follow the instructions at [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/).

|      | On many operating systems, Maven can be installed with a package manager. If you use OSX Homebrew, try `brew install maven`. Ubuntu users can run `sudo apt-get install maven`. Windows users with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) can run `choco install maven` from an elevated (administrator) prompt. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot dependencies use the `org.springframework.boot` `groupId`. Typically, your Maven POM file inherits from the `spring-boot-starter-parent` project and declares dependencies to one or more [“Starters”](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter). Spring Boot also provides an optional [Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin) to create executable jars.

The following listing shows a typical `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>myproject</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <!-- Inherit defaults from Spring Boot -->
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
    </parent>

    <!-- Override inherited settings -->

    <url/>

    <!-- Add typical dependencies for a web application -->
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <!-- Package as an executable jar -->
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

</project>
```

|      | The `spring-boot-starter-parent` is a great way to use Spring Boot, but it might not be suitable all of the time. Sometimes you may need to inherit from a different parent POM, or you might not like our default settings. In those cases, see [Using Spring Boot without the Parent POM](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-maven-without-a-parent) for an alternative solution that uses an `import` scope. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Gradle Installation

Spring Boot is compatible with 5.x and 6.x. 4.10 is also supported but this support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you do not already have Gradle installed, you can follow the instructions at [gradle.org](https://gradle.org/).

Spring Boot dependencies can be declared by using the `org.springframework.boot` `group`. Typically, your project declares dependencies to one or more [“Starters”](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter). Spring Boot provides a useful [Gradle plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins-gradle-plugin) that can be used to simplify dependency declarations and to create executable jars.

Gradle Wrapper

The Gradle Wrapper provides a nice way of “obtaining” Gradle when you need to build a project. It is a small script and library that you commit alongside your code to bootstrap the build process. See [docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) for details.

More details on getting started with Spring Boot and Gradle can be found in the [Getting Started section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html//#getting-started) of the Gradle plugin’s reference guide.

#### 2.3.2. Installing the Spring Boot CLI

The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command line tool that you can use to quickly prototype with Spring. It lets you run [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax without so much boilerplate code.

You do not need to use the CLI to work with Spring Boot, but it is definitely the quickest way to get a Spring application off the ground.

##### Manual Installation

You can download the Spring CLI distribution from the Spring software repository:

- [spring-boot-cli-2.2.9.RELEASE-bin.zip](https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-cli-2.2.9.RELEASE-bin.zip)
- [spring-boot-cli-2.2.9.RELEASE-bin.tar.gz](https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-cli-2.2.9.RELEASE-bin.tar.gz)

Cutting edge [snapshot distributions](https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/) are also available.

Once downloaded, follow the [INSTALL.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-cli/src/main/content/INSTALL.txt) instructions from the unpacked archive. In summary, there is a `spring` script (`spring.bat` for Windows) in a `bin/` directory in the `.zip` file. Alternatively, you can use `java -jar` with the `.jar` file (the script helps you to be sure that the classpath is set correctly).

##### Installation with SDKMAN!

SDKMAN! (The Software Development Kit Manager) can be used for managing multiple versions of various binary SDKs, including Groovy and the Spring Boot CLI. Get SDKMAN! from [sdkman.io](https://sdkman.io/) and install Spring Boot by using the following commands:

```
$ sdk install springboot
$ spring --version
Spring Boot v2.2.9.RELEASE
```

If you develop features for the CLI and want access to the version you built, use the following commands:

```
$ sdk install springboot dev /path/to/spring-boot/spring-boot-cli/target/spring-boot-cli-2.2.9.RELEASE-bin/spring-2.2.9.RELEASE/
$ sdk default springboot dev
$ spring --version
Spring CLI v2.2.9.RELEASE
```

The preceding instructions install a local instance of `spring` called the `dev` instance. It points at your target build location, so every time you rebuild Spring Boot, `spring` is up-to-date.

You can see it by running the following command:

```
$ sdk ls springboot

================================================================================
Available Springboot Versions
================================================================================
> + dev
* 2.2.9.RELEASE

================================================================================
+ - local version
* - installed
> - currently in use
================================================================================
```

##### OSX Homebrew Installation

If you are on a Mac and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following commands:

```
$ brew tap pivotal/tap
$ brew install springboot
```

Homebrew installs `spring` to `/usr/local/bin`.

|      | If you do not see the formula, your installation of brew might be out-of-date. In that case, run `brew update` and try again. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### MacPorts Installation

If you are on a Mac and use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), you can install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following command:

```
$ sudo port install spring-boot-cli
```

##### Command-line Completion

The Spring Boot CLI includes scripts that provide command completion for the [BASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) shells. You can `source` the script (also named `spring`) in any shell or put it in your personal or system-wide bash completion initialization. On a Debian system, the system-wide scripts are in `/shell-completion/bash` and all scripts in that directory are executed when a new shell starts. For example, to run the script manually if you have installed by using SDKMAN!, use the following commands:

```
$ . ~/.sdkman/candidates/springboot/current/shell-completion/bash/spring
$ spring <HIT TAB HERE>
  grab  help  jar  run  test  version
```

|      | If you install the Spring Boot CLI by using Homebrew or MacPorts, the command-line completion scripts are automatically registered with your shell. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Windows Scoop Installation

If you are on a Windows and use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), you can install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following commands:

```
> scoop bucket add extras
> scoop install springboot
```

Scoop installs `spring` to `~/scoop/apps/springboot/current/bin`.

|      | If you do not see the app manifest, your installation of scoop might be out-of-date. In that case, run `scoop update` and try again. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Quick-start Spring CLI Example

You can use the following web application to test your installation. To start, create a file called `app.groovy`, as follows:

```groovy
@RestController
class ThisWillActuallyRun {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    String home() {
        "Hello World!"
    }

}
```

Then run it from a shell, as follows:

```
$ spring run app.groovy
```

|      | The first run of your application is slow, as dependencies are downloaded. Subsequent runs are much quicker. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Open `localhost:8080` in your favorite web browser. You should see the following output:

```
Hello World!
```

#### 2.3.3. Upgrading from an Earlier Version of Spring Boot

If you are upgrading from the `1.x` release of Spring Boot, check the [“migration guide” on the project wiki](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide) that provides detailed upgrade instructions. Check also the [“release notes”](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki) for a list of “new and noteworthy” features for each release.

When upgrading to a new feature release, some properties may have been renamed or removed. Spring Boot provides a way to analyze your application’s environment and print diagnostics at startup, but also temporarily migrate properties at runtime for you. To enable that feature, add the following dependency to your project:

```xml

To upgrade an existing CLI installation, use the appropriate package manager command (for example, `brew upgrade`). If you manually installed the CLI, follow the [standard instructions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-manual-cli-installation), remembering to update your `PATH` environment variable to remove any older references.

### 2.4. Developing Your First Spring Boot Application

This section describes how to develop a small “Hello World!” web application that highlights some of Spring Boot’s key features. We use Maven to build this project, since most IDEs support it.

|      | The [spring.io](https://spring.io/) web site contains many “Getting Started” [guides](https://spring.io/guides) that use Spring Boot. If you need to solve a specific problem, check there first.You can shortcut the steps below by going to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and choosing the "Web" starter from the dependencies searcher. Doing so generates a new project structure so that you can [start coding right away](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-code). Check the [Spring Initializr documentation](https://docs.spring.io/initializr/docs/current/reference/html//#user-guide) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Before we begin, open a terminal and run the following commands to ensure that you have valid versions of Java and Maven installed:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.5.4 (1edded0938998edf8bf061f1ceb3cfdeccf443fe; 2018-06-17T14:33:14-04:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.9/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_102, vendor: Oracle Corporation
```

|      | This sample needs to be created in its own folder. Subsequent instructions assume that you have created a suitable folder and that it is your current directory. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 2.4.1. Creating the POM

We need to start by creating a Maven `pom.xml` file. The `pom.xml` is the recipe that is used to build your project. Open your favorite text editor and add the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>myproject</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
    </parent>

    <description/>
    <developers>
        <developer/>
    </developers>
    <licenses>
        <license/>
    </licenses>
    <scm>
        <url/>
    </scm>
    <url/>

    <!-- Additional lines to be added here... -->

</project>
```

The preceding listing should give you a working build. You can test it by running `mvn package` (for now, you can ignore the “jar will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!” warning).

|      | At this point, you could import the project into an IDE (most modern Java IDEs include built-in support for Maven). For simplicity, we continue to use a plain text editor for this example. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 2.4.2. Adding Classpath Dependencies

Spring Boot provides a number of “Starters” that let you add jars to your classpath. Our applications for smoke tests use the `spring-boot-starter-parent` in the `parent` section of the POM. The `spring-boot-starter-parent` is a special starter that provides useful Maven defaults. It also provides a [`dependency-management`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-dependency-management) section so that you can omit `version` tags for “blessed” dependencies.

Other “Starters” provide dependencies that you are likely to need when developing a specific type of application. Since we are developing a web application, we add a `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency. Before that, we can look at what we currently have by running the following command:

```
$ mvn dependency:tree

[INFO] com.example:myproject:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

The `mvn dependency:tree` command prints a tree representation of your project dependencies. You can see that `spring-boot-starter-parent` provides no dependencies by itself. To add the necessary dependencies, edit your `pom.xml` and add the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency immediately below the `parent` section:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you run `mvn dependency:tree` again, you see that there are now a number of additional dependencies, including the Tomcat web server and Spring Boot itself.

#### 2.4.3. Writing the Code

To finish our application, we need to create a single Java file. By default, Maven compiles sources from `src/main/java`, so you need to create that folder structure and then add a file named `src/main/java/Example.java` to contain the following code:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class Example {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Example.class, args);
    }

}
```

Although there is not much code here, quite a lot is going on. We step through the important parts in the next few sections.

##### The @RestController and @RequestMapping Annotations

The first annotation on our `Example` class is `@RestController`. This is known as a *stereotype* annotation. It provides hints for people reading the code and for Spring that the class plays a specific role. In this case, our class is a web `@Controller`, so Spring considers it when handling incoming web requests.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation provides “routing” information. It tells Spring that any HTTP request with the `/` path should be mapped to the `home` method. The `@RestController` annotation tells Spring to render the resulting string directly back to the caller.

|      | The `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` annotations are Spring MVC annotations (they are not specific to Spring Boot). See the [MVC section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc) in the Spring Reference Documentation for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### The @EnableAutoConfiguration Annotation

The second class-level annotation is `@EnableAutoConfiguration`. This annotation tells Spring Boot to “guess” how you want to configure Spring, based on the jar dependencies that you have added. Since `spring-boot-starter-web` added Tomcat and Spring MVC, the auto-configuration assumes that you are developing a web application and sets up Spring accordingly.

Starters and Auto-configuration

Auto-configuration is designed to work well with “Starters”, but the two concepts are not directly tied. You are free to pick and choose jar dependencies outside of the starters. Spring Boot still does its best to auto-configure your application.

##### The “main” Method

The final part of our application is the `main` method. This is a standard method that follows the Java convention for an application entry point. Our main method delegates to Spring Boot’s `SpringApplication` class by calling `run`. `SpringApplication` bootstraps our application, starting Spring, which, in turn, starts the auto-configured Tomcat web server. We need to pass `Example.class` as an argument to the `run` method to tell `SpringApplication` which is the primary Spring component. The `args` array is also passed through to expose any command-line arguments.

#### 2.4.4. Running the Example

At this point, your application should work. Since you used the `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM, you have a useful `run` goal that you can use to start the application. Type `mvn spring-boot:run` from the root project directory to start the application. You should see output similar to the following:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run

  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::  (v2.2.9.RELEASE)
....... . . .
....... . . . (log output here)
....... . . .
........ Started Example in 2.222 seconds (JVM running for 6.514)
```

If you open a web browser to `localhost:8080`, you should see the following output:

```
Hello World!
```

To gracefully exit the application, press `ctrl-c`.

#### 2.4.5. Creating an Executable Jar

We finish our example by creating a completely self-contained executable jar file that we could run in production. Executable jars (sometimes called “fat jars”) are archives containing your compiled classes along with all of the jar dependencies that your code needs to run.

Executable jars and Java

Java does not provide a standard way to load nested jar files (jar files that are themselves contained within a jar). This can be problematic if you are looking to distribute a self-contained application.

To solve this problem, many developers use “uber” jars. An uber jar packages all the classes from all the application’s dependencies into a single archive. The problem with this approach is that it becomes hard to see which libraries are in your application. It can also be problematic if the same filename is used (but with different content) in multiple jars.

Spring Boot takes a [different approach](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#executable-jar) and lets you actually nest jars directly.

To create an executable jar, we need to add the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` to our `pom.xml`. To do so, insert the following lines just below the `dependencies` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

|      | The `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM includes `` configuration to bind the `repackage` goal. If you do not use the parent POM, you need to declare this configuration yourself. See the [plugin documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin//usage.html) for details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Save your `pom.xml` and run `mvn package` from the command line, as follows:

```
$ mvn package

[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Building myproject 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

[INFO] --- spring-boot-maven-plugin:2.2.9.RELEASE:repackage (default) @ myproject ---
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If you look in the `target` directory, you should see `myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. The file should be around 10 MB in size. If you want to peek inside, you can use `jar tvf`, as follows:

```
$ jar tvf target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

You should also see a much smaller file named `myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original` in the `target` directory. This is the original jar file that Maven created before it was repackaged by Spring Boot.

To run that application, use the `java -jar` command, as follows:

```
$ java -jar target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

  .   ____          _            __ _ _

....... . . .
....... . . . (log output here)
....... . . .
........ Started Example in 2.536 seconds (JVM running for 2.864)
```

As before, to exit the application, press `ctrl-c`.

### 2.5. What to Read Next

Hopefully, this section provided some of the Spring Boot basics and got you on your way to writing your own applications. If you are a task-oriented type of developer, you might want to jump over to [spring.io](https://spring.io/) and check out some of the [getting started](https://spring.io/guides/) guides that solve specific “How do I do that with Spring?” problems. We also have Spring Boot-specific “[How-to](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto)” reference documentation.

Otherwise, the next logical step is to read *[Using Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot)*. If you are really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about *[Spring Boot features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features)*.

## 3. Using Spring Boot

This section goes into more detail about how you should use Spring Boot. It covers topics such as build systems, auto-configuration, and how to run your applications. We also cover some Spring Boot best practices. Although there is nothing particularly special about Spring Boot (it is just another library that you can consume), there are a few recommendations that, when followed, make your development process a little easier.

If you are starting out with Spring Boot, you should probably read the *[Getting Started](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started)* guide before diving into this section.

### 3.1. Build Systems

It is strongly recommended that you choose a build system that supports [*dependency management*](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-dependency-management) and that can consume artifacts published to the “Maven Central” repository. We would recommend that you choose Maven or Gradle. It is possible to get Spring Boot to work with other build systems (Ant, for example), but they are not particularly well supported.

#### 3.1.1. Dependency Management

Each release of Spring Boot provides a curated list of dependencies that it supports. In practice, you do not need to provide a version for any of these dependencies in your build configuration, as Spring Boot manages that for you. When you upgrade Spring Boot itself, these dependencies are upgraded as well in a consistent way.

|      | You can still specify a version and override Spring Boot’s recommendations if you need to do so. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The curated list contains all the spring modules that you can use with Spring Boot as well as a refined list of third party libraries. The list is available as a standard [Bills of Materials (`spring-boot-dependencies`)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-maven-without-a-parent) that can be used with both [Maven](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-maven-parent-pom) and [Gradle](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-gradle).

|      | Each release of Spring Boot is associated with a base version of the Spring Framework. We **highly** recommend that you not specify its version. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.1.2. Maven

Maven users can inherit from the `spring-boot-starter-parent` project to obtain sensible defaults. The parent project provides the following features:

- Java 1.8 as the default compiler level.
- UTF-8 source encoding.
- A [Dependency Management section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-dependency-management), inherited from the spring-boot-dependencies pom, that manages the versions of common dependencies. This dependency management lets you omit <version> tags for those dependencies when used in your own pom.
- An execution of the [`repackage` goal](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin//repackage-mojo.html) with a `repackage` execution id.
- Sensible [resource filtering](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html).
- Sensible plugin configuration ([exec plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/), [Git commit ID](https://github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin), and [shade](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)).
- Sensible resource filtering for `application.properties` and `application.yml` including profile-specific files (for example, `application-dev.properties` and `application-dev.yml`)

Note that, since the `application.properties` and `application.yml` files accept Spring style placeholders (`${…}`), the Maven filtering is changed to use `@..@` placeholders. (You can override that by setting a Maven property called `resource.delimiter`.)

##### Inheriting the Starter Parent

To configure your project to inherit from the `spring-boot-starter-parent`, set the `parent` as follows:

```xml
<!-- Inherit defaults from Spring Boot -->
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
</parent>
```

|      | You should need to specify only the Spring Boot version number on this dependency. If you import additional starters, you can safely omit the version number. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

With that setup, you can also override individual dependencies by overriding a property in your own project. For instance, to upgrade to another Spring Data release train, you would add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <spring-data-releasetrain.version>Fowler-SR2</spring-data-releasetrain.version>
</properties>
```

|      | Check the [`spring-boot-dependencies` pom](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/pom.xml) for a list of supported properties. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Using Spring Boot without the Parent POM

Not everyone likes inheriting from the `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM. You may have your own corporate standard parent that you need to use or you may prefer to explicitly declare all your Maven configuration.

If you do not want to use the `spring-boot-starter-parent`, you can still keep the benefit of the dependency management (but not the plugin management) by using a `scope=import` dependency, as follows:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <!-- Import dependency management from Spring Boot -->
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

The preceding sample setup does not let you override individual dependencies by using a property, as explained above. To achieve the same result, you need to add an entry in the `dependencyManagement` of your project **before** the `spring-boot-dependencies` entry. For instance, to upgrade to another Spring Data release train, you could add the following element to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Override Spring Data release train provided by Spring Boot -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-data-releasetrain</artifactId>
            <version>Fowler-SR2</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

|      | In the preceding example, we specify a *BOM*, but any dependency type can be overridden in the same way. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Using the Spring Boot Maven Plugin

Spring Boot includes a [Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin) that can package the project as an executable jar. Add the plugin to your `` section if you want to use it, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

|      | If you use the Spring Boot starter parent pom, you need to add only the plugin. There is no need to configure it unless you want to change the settings defined in the parent. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.1.3. Gradle

To learn about using Spring Boot with Gradle, please refer to the documentation for Spring Boot’s Gradle plugin:

- Reference ([HTML](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html/) and [PDF](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/pdf/spring-boot-gradle-plugin-reference.pdf))
- [API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/api/)

#### 3.1.4. Ant

It is possible to build a Spring Boot project using Apache Ant+Ivy. The `spring-boot-antlib` “AntLib” module is also available to help Ant create executable jars.

To declare dependencies, a typical `ivy.xml` file looks something like the following example:

```xml
<ivy-module version="2.0">
    <info organisation="org.springframework.boot" module="spring-boot-sample-ant" />
    <configurations>
        <conf name="compile" description="everything needed to compile this module" />
        <conf name="runtime" extends="compile" description="everything needed to run this module" />
    </configurations>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency org="org.springframework.boot" name="spring-boot-starter"
            rev="${spring-boot.version}" conf="compile" />
    </dependencies>
</ivy-module>
```

A typical `build.xml` looks like the following example:

```xml
<project
    xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant"
    xmlns:spring-boot="antlib:org.springframework.boot.ant"
    name="myapp" default="build">

    <property name="spring-boot.version" value="2.2.9.RELEASE" />

    <target name="resolve" description="--> retrieve dependencies with ivy">
        <ivy:retrieve pattern="lib/[conf]/[artifact]-[type]-[revision].[ext]" />
    </target>

    <target name="classpaths" depends="resolve">
        <path id="compile.classpath">
            <fileset dir="lib/compile" includes="*.jar" />
        </path>

#### 3.1.5. Starters

Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. You get a one-stop shop for all the Spring and related technologies that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy-paste loads of dependency descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access, include the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency in your project.

The starters contain a lot of the dependencies that you need to get a project up and running quickly and with a consistent, supported set of managed transitive dependencies.

What’s in a name

All **official** starters follow a similar naming pattern; `spring-boot-starter-*`, where `*` is a particular type of application. This naming structure is intended to help when you need to find a starter. The Maven integration in many IDEs lets you search dependencies by name. For example, with the appropriate Eclipse or STS plugin installed, you can press `ctrl-space` in the POM editor and type “spring-boot-starter” for a complete list.

As explained in the “[Creating Your Own Starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-starter)” section, third party starters should not start with `spring-boot`, as it is reserved for official Spring Boot artifacts. Rather, a third-party starter typically starts with the name of the project. For example, a third-party starter project called `thirdpartyproject` would typically be named `thirdpartyproject-spring-boot-starter`.

The following application starters are provided by Spring Boot under the `org.springframework.boot` group:

### 3.2. Structuring Your Code

Spring Boot does not require any specific code layout to work. However, there are some best practices that help.

#### 3.2.1. Using the “default” Package

When a class does not include a `package` declaration, it is considered to be in the “default package”. The use of the “default package” is generally discouraged and should be avoided. It can cause particular problems for Spring Boot applications that use the `@ComponentScan`, `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan`, `@EntityScan`, or `@SpringBootApplication` annotations, since every class from every jar is read.

|      | We recommend that you follow Java’s recommended package naming conventions and use a reversed domain name (for example, `com.example.project`). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.2.2. Locating the Main Application Class

We generally recommend that you locate your main application class in a root package above other classes. The [`@SpringBootApplication` annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-using-springbootapplication-annotation) is often placed on your main class, and it implicitly defines a base “search package” for certain items. For example, if you are writing a JPA application, the package of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotated class is used to search for `@Entity` items. Using a root package also allows component scan to apply only on your project.

|      | If you don’t want to use `@SpringBootApplication`, the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `@ComponentScan` annotations that it imports defines that behaviour so you can also use those instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following listing shows a typical layout:

```
com
 +- example
     +- myapplication
         +- Application.java
         |
         +- customer
         |   +- Customer.java
         |   +- CustomerController.java
         |   +- CustomerService.java
         |   +- CustomerRepository.java
         |
         +- order
             +- Order.java
             +- OrderController.java
             +- OrderService.java
             +- OrderRepository.java
```

The `Application.java` file would declare the `main` method, along with the basic `@SpringBootApplication`, as follows:

```java
package com.example.myapplication;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

### 3.3. Configuration Classes

Spring Boot favors Java-based configuration. Although it is possible to use `SpringApplication` with XML sources, we generally recommend that your primary source be a single `@Configuration` class. Usually the class that defines the `main` method is a good candidate as the primary `@Configuration`.

|      | Many Spring configuration examples have been published on the Internet that use XML configuration. If possible, always try to use the equivalent Java-based configuration. Searching for `Enable*` annotations can be a good starting point. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.3.1. Importing Additional Configuration Classes

You need not put all your `@Configuration` into a single class. The `@Import` annotation can be used to import additional configuration classes. Alternatively, you can use `@ComponentScan` to automatically pick up all Spring components, including `@Configuration` classes.

#### 3.3.2. Importing XML Configuration

If you absolutely must use XML based configuration, we recommend that you still start with a `@Configuration` class. You can then use an `@ImportResource` annotation to load XML configuration files.

### 3.4. Auto-configuration

Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added. For example, if `HSQLDB` is on your classpath, and you have not manually configured any database connection beans, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.

You need to opt-in to auto-configuration by adding the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication` annotations to one of your `@Configuration` classes.

|      | You should only ever add one `@SpringBootApplication` or `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation. We generally recommend that you add one or the other to your primary `@Configuration` class only. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.4.1. Gradually Replacing Auto-configuration

Auto-configuration is non-invasive. At any point, you can start to define your own configuration to replace specific parts of the auto-configuration. For example, if you add your own `DataSource` bean, the default embedded database support backs away.

If you need to find out what auto-configuration is currently being applied, and why, start your application with the `--debug` switch. Doing so enables debug logs for a selection of core loggers and logs a conditions report to the console.

#### 3.4.2. Disabling Specific Auto-configuration Classes

If you find that specific auto-configuration classes that you do not want are being applied, you can use the exclude attribute of `@SpringBootApplication` to disable them, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.*;

@SpringBootApplication(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyApplication {
}
```

If the class is not on the classpath, you can use the `excludeName` attribute of the annotation and specify the fully qualified name instead. If you prefer to use `@EnableAutoConfiguration` rather than `@SpringBootApplication`, `exclude` and `excludeName` are also available. Finally, you can also control the list of auto-configuration classes to exclude by using the `spring.autoconfigure.exclude` property.

|      | You can define exclusions both at the annotation level and by using the property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Even though auto-configuration classes are `public`, the only aspect of the class that is considered public API is the name of the class which can be used for disabling the auto-configuration. The actual contents of those classes, such as nested configuration classes or bean methods are for internal use only and we do not recommend using those directly. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 3.5. Spring Beans and Dependency Injection

You are free to use any of the standard Spring Framework techniques to define your beans and their injected dependencies. We often find that using `@ComponentScan` (to find your beans) and using `@Autowired` (to do constructor injection) works well.

If you structure your code as suggested above (locating your application class in a root package), you can add `@ComponentScan` without any arguments. All of your application components (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller` etc.) are automatically registered as Spring Beans.

The following example shows a `@Service` Bean that uses constructor injection to obtain a required `RiskAssessor` bean:

```java
package com.example.service;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class DatabaseAccountService implements AccountService {

    private final RiskAssessor riskAssessor;

    @Autowired
    public DatabaseAccountService(RiskAssessor riskAssessor) {
        this.riskAssessor = riskAssessor;
    }

    // ...

}
```

If a bean has one constructor, you can omit the `@Autowired`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Service
public class DatabaseAccountService implements AccountService {

    private final RiskAssessor riskAssessor;

    public DatabaseAccountService(RiskAssessor riskAssessor) {
        this.riskAssessor = riskAssessor;
    }

    // ...

}
```

|      | Notice how using constructor injection lets the `riskAssessor` field be marked as `final`, indicating that it cannot be subsequently changed. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 3.6. Using the @SpringBootApplication Annotation

Many Spring Boot developers like their apps to use auto-configuration, component scan and be able to define extra configuration on their "application class". A single `@SpringBootApplication` annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:

- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: enable [Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-auto-configuration)
- `@ComponentScan`: enable `@Component` scan on the package where the application is located (see [the best practices](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-structuring-your-code))
- `@Configuration`: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes

```java
package com.example.myapplication;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication // same as @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

|      | `@SpringBootApplication` also provides aliases to customize the attributes of `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `@ComponentScan`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | None of these features are mandatory and you may choose to replace this single annotation by any of the features that it enables. For instance, you may not want to use component scan or configuration properties scan in your application:`package com.example.myapplication; import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import; @Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) @EnableAutoConfiguration @Import({ MyConfig.class, MyAnotherConfig.class }) public class Application {     public static void main(String[] args) {            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);    } }`In this example, `Application` is just like any other Spring Boot application except that `@Component`-annotated classes and `@ConfigurationProperties`-annotated classes are not detected automatically and the user-defined beans are imported explicitly (see `@Import`). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 3.7. Running Your Application

One of the biggest advantages of packaging your application as a jar and using an embedded HTTP server is that you can run your application as you would any other. The sample applies to debugging Spring Boot applications. You do not need any special IDE plugins or extensions.

|      | This section only covers jar based packaging. If you choose to package your application as a war file, you should refer to your server and IDE documentation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.7.1. Running from an IDE

You can run a Spring Boot application from your IDE as a Java application. However, you first need to import your project. Import steps vary depending on your IDE and build system. Most IDEs can import Maven projects directly. For example, Eclipse users can select `Import…` → `Existing Maven Projects` from the `File` menu.

If you cannot directly import your project into your IDE, you may be able to generate IDE metadata by using a build plugin. Maven includes plugins for [Eclipse](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/) and [IDEA](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-idea-plugin/). Gradle offers plugins for [various IDEs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).

|      | If you accidentally run a web application twice, you see a “Port already in use” error. STS users can use the `Relaunch` button rather than the `Run` button to ensure that any existing instance is closed. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.7.2. Running as a Packaged Application

If you use the Spring Boot Maven or Gradle plugins to create an executable jar, you can run your application using `java -jar`, as shown in the following example:

```
$ java -jar target/myapplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

It is also possible to run a packaged application with remote debugging support enabled. Doing so lets you attach a debugger to your packaged application, as shown in the following example:

```
$ java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n \
       -jar target/myapplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### 3.7.3. Using the Maven Plugin

The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a `run` goal that can be used to quickly compile and run your application. Applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE. The following example shows a typical Maven command to run a Spring Boot application:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

You might also want to use the `MAVEN_OPTS` operating system environment variable, as shown in the following example:

```
$ export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m
```

#### 3.7.4. Using the Gradle Plugin

The Spring Boot Gradle plugin also includes a `bootRun` task that can be used to run your application in an exploded form. The `bootRun` task is added whenever you apply the `org.springframework.boot` and `java` plugins and is shown in the following example:

```
$ gradle bootRun
```

You might also want to use the `JAVA_OPTS` operating system environment variable, as shown in the following example:

```
$ export JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx1024m
```

#### 3.7.5. Hot Swapping

Since Spring Boot applications are plain Java applications, JVM hot-swapping should work out of the box. JVM hot swapping is somewhat limited with the bytecode that it can replace. For a more complete solution, [JRebel](https://www.jrebel.com/products/jrebel) can be used.

The `spring-boot-devtools` module also includes support for quick application restarts. See the [Developer Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools) section later in this chapter and the [Hot swapping “How-to”](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-hotswapping) for details.

### 3.8. Developer Tools

Spring Boot includes an additional set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant. The `spring-boot-devtools` module can be included in any project to provide additional development-time features. To include devtools support, add the module dependency to your build, as shown in the following listings for Maven and Gradle:

Maven

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Gradle

```groovy
configurations {
    developmentOnly
    runtimeClasspath {
        extendsFrom developmentOnly
    }
}
dependencies {
    developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
}
```

|      | Developer tools are automatically disabled when running a fully packaged application. If your application is launched from `java -jar` or if it is started from a special classloader, then it is considered a “production application”. If that does not apply to you (i.e. if you run your application from a container), consider excluding devtools or set the `-Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=false` system property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Flagging the dependency as optional in Maven or using a custom `developmentOnly` configuration in Gradle (as shown above) is a best practice that prevents devtools from being transitively applied to other modules that use your project. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Repackaged archives do not contain devtools by default. If you want to use a [certain remote devtools feature](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-remote), you need to disable the `excludeDevtools` build property to include it. The property is supported with both the Maven and Gradle plugins. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.8.1. Property Defaults

Several of the libraries supported by Spring Boot use caches to improve performance. For example, [template engines](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-template-engines) cache compiled templates to avoid repeatedly parsing template files. Also, Spring MVC can add HTTP caching headers to responses when serving static resources.

While caching is very beneficial in production, it can be counter-productive during development, preventing you from seeing the changes you just made in your application. For this reason, spring-boot-devtools disables the caching options by default.

Cache options are usually configured by settings in your `application.properties` file. For example, Thymeleaf offers the `spring.thymeleaf.cache` property. Rather than needing to set these properties manually, the `spring-boot-devtools` module automatically applies sensible development-time configuration.

Because you need more information about web requests while developing Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux applications, developer tools will enable `DEBUG` logging for the `web` logging group. This will give you information about the incoming request, which handler is processing it, the response outcome, etc. If you wish to log all request details (including potentially sensitive information), you can turn on the `spring.http.log-request-details` configuration property.

|      | If you don’t want property defaults to be applied you can set `spring.devtools.add-properties` to `false` in your `application.properties`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | For a complete list of the properties that are applied by the devtools, see [DevToolsPropertyDefaultsPostProcessor](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-devtools/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/devtools/env/DevToolsPropertyDefaultsPostProcessor.java). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.8.2. Automatic Restart

Applications that use `spring-boot-devtools` automatically restart whenever files on the classpath change. This can be a useful feature when working in an IDE, as it gives a very fast feedback loop for code changes. By default, any entry on the classpath that points to a folder is monitored for changes. Note that certain resources, such as static assets and view templates, [do not need to restart the application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-restart-exclude).

Triggering a restart

As DevTools monitors classpath resources, the only way to trigger a restart is to update the classpath. The way in which you cause the classpath to be updated depends on the IDE that you are using. In Eclipse, saving a modified file causes the classpath to be updated and triggers a restart. In IntelliJ IDEA, building the project (`Build +→+ Build Project`) has the same effect.

|      | As long as forking is enabled, you can also start your application by using the supported build plugins (Maven and Gradle), since DevTools needs an isolated application classloader to operate properly. By default, the Gradle and Maven plugins fork the application process. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Automatic restart works very well when used with LiveReload. [See the LiveReload section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-livereload) for details. If you use JRebel, automatic restarts are disabled in favor of dynamic class reloading. Other devtools features (such as LiveReload and property overrides) can still be used. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | DevTools relies on the application context’s shutdown hook to close it during a restart. It does not work correctly if you have disabled the shutdown hook (`SpringApplication.setRegisterShutdownHook(false)`). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | When deciding if an entry on the classpath should trigger a restart when it changes, DevTools automatically ignores projects named `spring-boot`, `spring-boot-devtools`, `spring-boot-autoconfigure`, `spring-boot-actuator`, and `spring-boot-starter`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | DevTools needs to customize the `ResourceLoader` used by the `ApplicationContext`. If your application provides one already, it is going to be wrapped. Direct override of the `getResource` method on the `ApplicationContext` is not supported. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Restart vs Reload

The restart technology provided by Spring Boot works by using two classloaders. Classes that do not change (for example, those from third-party jars) are loaded into a *base* classloader. Classes that you are actively developing are loaded into a *restart* classloader. When the application is restarted, the *restart* classloader is thrown away and a new one is created. This approach means that application restarts are typically much faster than “cold starts”, since the *base* classloader is already available and populated.

If you find that restarts are not quick enough for your applications or you encounter classloading issues, you could consider reloading technologies such as [JRebel](https://jrebel.com/software/jrebel/) from ZeroTurnaround. These work by rewriting classes as they are loaded to make them more amenable to reloading.

##### Logging changes in condition evaluation

By default, each time your application restarts, a report showing the condition evaluation delta is logged. The report shows the changes to your application’s auto-configuration as you make changes such as adding or removing beans and setting configuration properties.

To disable the logging of the report, set the following property:

```
spring.devtools.restart.log-condition-evaluation-delta=false
```

##### Excluding Resources

Certain resources do not necessarily need to trigger a restart when they are changed. For example, Thymeleaf templates can be edited in-place. By default, changing resources in `/META-INF/maven`, `/META-INF/resources`, `/resources`, `/static`, `/public`, or `/templates` does not trigger a restart but does trigger a [live reload](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-livereload). If you want to customize these exclusions, you can use the `spring.devtools.restart.exclude` property. For example, to exclude only `/static` and `/public` you would set the following property:

```
spring.devtools.restart.exclude=static/**,public/**
```

|      | If you want to keep those defaults and *add* additional exclusions, use the `spring.devtools.restart.additional-exclude` property instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Watching Additional Paths

You may want your application to be restarted or reloaded when you make changes to files that are not on the classpath. To do so, use the `spring.devtools.restart.additional-paths` property to configure additional paths to watch for changes. You can use the `spring.devtools.restart.exclude` property [described earlier](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-restart-exclude) to control whether changes beneath the additional paths trigger a full restart or a [live reload](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-livereload).

##### Disabling Restart

If you do not want to use the restart feature, you can disable it by using the `spring.devtools.restart.enabled` property. In most cases, you can set this property in your `application.properties` (doing so still initializes the restart classloader, but it does not watch for file changes).

If you need to *completely* disable restart support (for example, because it does not work with a specific library), you need to set the `spring.devtools.restart.enabled` `System` property to `false` before calling `SpringApplication.run(…)`, as shown in the following example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.setProperty("spring.devtools.restart.enabled", "false");
    SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
}
```

##### Using a Trigger File

If you work with an IDE that continuously compiles changed files, you might prefer to trigger restarts only at specific times. To do so, you can use a “trigger file”, which is a special file that must be modified when you want to actually trigger a restart check.

|      | Any update to the file will trigger a check, but restart only actually occurs if Devtools has detected it has something to do. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To use a trigger file, set the `spring.devtools.restart.trigger-file` property to the name (excluding any path) of your trigger file. The trigger file must appear somewhere on your classpath.

For example, if you have a project with the following structure:

```
src
+- main
   +- resources
      +- .reloadtrigger
```

Then your `trigger-file` property would be:

```properties
spring.devtools.restart.trigger-file=.reloadtrigger
```

Restarts will now only happen when the `src/main/resources/.reloadtrigger` is updated.

|      | You might want to set `spring.devtools.restart.trigger-file` as a [global setting](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-globalsettings), so that all your projects behave in the same way. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Some IDEs have features that save you from needing to update your trigger file manually. [Spring Tools for Eclipse](https://spring.io/tools) and [IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) both have such support. With Spring Tools, you can use the “reload” button from the console view (as long as your `trigger-file` is named `.reloadtrigger`). For IntelliJ, you can follow the [instructions in their documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html#configure-application-update-policies-with-devtools).

##### Customizing the Restart Classloader

As described earlier in the [Restart vs Reload](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-spring-boot-restart-vs-reload) section, restart functionality is implemented by using two classloaders. For most applications, this approach works well. However, it can sometimes cause classloading issues.

By default, any open project in your IDE is loaded with the “restart” classloader, and any regular `.jar` file is loaded with the “base” classloader. If you work on a multi-module project, and not every module is imported into your IDE, you may need to customize things. To do so, you can create a `META-INF/spring-devtools.properties` file.

The `spring-devtools.properties` file can contain properties prefixed with `restart.exclude` and `restart.include`. The `include` elements are items that should be pulled up into the “restart” classloader, and the `exclude` elements are items that should be pushed down into the “base” classloader. The value of the property is a regex pattern that is applied to the classpath, as shown in the following example:

```properties
restart.exclude.companycommonlibs=/mycorp-common-[\\w\\d-\.]+\.jar
restart.include.projectcommon=/mycorp-myproj-[\\w\\d-\.]+\.jar
```

|      | All property keys must be unique. As long as a property starts with `restart.include.` or `restart.exclude.` it is considered. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | All `META-INF/spring-devtools.properties` from the classpath are loaded. You can package files inside your project, or in the libraries that the project consumes. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Known Limitations

Restart functionality does not work well with objects that are deserialized by using a standard `ObjectInputStream`. If you need to deserialize data, you may need to use Spring’s `ConfigurableObjectInputStream` in combination with `Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()`.

Unfortunately, several third-party libraries deserialize without considering the context classloader. If you find such a problem, you need to request a fix with the original authors.

#### 3.8.3. LiveReload

The `spring-boot-devtools` module includes an embedded LiveReload server that can be used to trigger a browser refresh when a resource is changed. LiveReload browser extensions are freely available for Chrome, Firefox and Safari from [livereload.com](http://livereload.com/extensions/).

If you do not want to start the LiveReload server when your application runs, you can set the `spring.devtools.livereload.enabled` property to `false`.

|      | You can only run one LiveReload server at a time. Before starting your application, ensure that no other LiveReload servers are running. If you start multiple applications from your IDE, only the first has LiveReload support. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 3.8.4. Global Settings

You can configure global devtools settings by adding any of the following files to the `$HOME/.config/spring-boot` folder:

1. `spring-boot-devtools.properties`
2. `spring-boot-devtools.yaml`
3. `spring-boot-devtools.yml`

Any properties added to these file apply to *all* Spring Boot applications on your machine that use devtools. For example, to configure restart to always use a [trigger file](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-restart-triggerfile), you would add the following property:

~/.config/spring-boot/spring-boot-devtools.properties

```properties
spring.devtools.restart.trigger-file=.reloadtrigger
```

|      | If devtools configuration files are not found in `$HOME/.config/spring-boot`, the root of the `$HOME` folder is searched for the presence of a `.spring-boot-devtools.properties` file. This allows you to share the devtools global configuration with applications that are on an older version of Spring Boot that does not support the `$HOME/.config/spring-boot` location. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Profiles are not supported in devtools properties/yaml files.Any profiles activated in `.spring-boot-devtools.properties` will not affect the loading of [profile-specific configuration files](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-profile-specific-properties). Profile specific filenames (of the form `spring-boot-devtools-.properties`) and `spring.profile` sub-documents in YAML files are not supported. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Configuring File System Watcher

[FileSystemWatcher](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-devtools/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/devtools/filewatch/FileSystemWatcher.java) works by polling the class changes with a certain time interval, and then waiting for a predefined quiet period to make sure there are no more changes. Since Spring Boot relies entirely on the IDE to compile and copy files into the location from where Spring Boot can read them, you might find that there are times when certain changes are not reflected when devtools restarts the application. If you observe such problems constantly, try increasing the `spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval` and `spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period` parameters to the values that fit your development environment:

```properties
spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval=2s
spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period=1s
```

The monitored classpath folders are now polled every 2 seconds for changes, and a 1 second quiet period is maintained to make sure there are no additional class changes.

#### 3.8.5. Remote Applications

The Spring Boot developer tools are not limited to local development. You can also use several features when running applications remotely. Remote support is opt-in as enabling it can be a security risk. It should only be enabled when running on a trusted network or when secured with SSL. If neither of these options is available to you, you should not use DevTools' remote support. You should never enable support on a production deployment.

To enable it, you need to make sure that `devtools` is included in the repackaged archive, as shown in the following listing:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <excludeDevtools>false</excludeDevtools>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

Then you need to set the `spring.devtools.remote.secret` property. Like any important password or secret, the value should be unique and strong such that it cannot be guessed or brute-forced.

Remote devtools support is provided in two parts: a server-side endpoint that accepts connections and a client application that you run in your IDE. The server component is automatically enabled when the `spring.devtools.remote.secret` property is set. The client component must be launched manually.

##### Running the Remote Client Application

The remote client application is designed to be run from within your IDE. You need to run `org.springframework.boot.devtools.RemoteSpringApplication` with the same classpath as the remote project that you connect to. The application’s single required argument is the remote URL to which it connects.

For example, if you are using Eclipse or STS and you have a project named `my-app` that you have deployed to Cloud Foundry, you would do the following:

- Select `Run Configurations…` from the `Run` menu.
- Create a new `Java Application` “launch configuration”.
- Browse for the `my-app` project.
- Use `org.springframework.boot.devtools.RemoteSpringApplication` as the main class.
- Add `https://myapp.cfapps.io` to the `Program arguments` (or whatever your remote URL is).

A running remote client might resemble the following listing:

```

|      | Because the remote client is using the same classpath as the real application it can directly read application properties. This is how the `spring.devtools.remote.secret` property is read and passed to the server for authentication. |

##### Remote Update

The remote client monitors your application classpath for changes in the same way as the [local restart](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-restart). Any updated resource is pushed to the remote application and (*if required*) triggers a restart. This can be helpful if you iterate on a feature that uses a cloud service that you do not have locally. Generally, remote updates and restarts are much quicker than a full rebuild and deploy cycle.

On a slower development environment, it may happen that the quiet period is not enough, and the changes in the classes may be split into batches. The server is restarted after the first batch of class changes is uploaded. The next batch can’t be sent to the application, since the server is restarting.

This is typically manifested by a warning in the `RemoteSpringApplication` logs about failing to upload some of the classes, and a consequent retry. But it may also lead to application code inconsistency and failure to restart after the first batch of changes is uploaded. If you observe such problems constantly, try increasing the `spring.devtools.restart.poll-interval` and `spring.devtools.restart.quiet-period` parameters to the values that fit your development environment. See the [Configuring File System Watcher](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuring-file-system-watcher) section for configuring these properties.

|      | Files are only monitored when the remote client is running. If you change a file before starting the remote client, it is not pushed to the remote server. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 3.9. Packaging Your Application for Production

Executable jars can be used for production deployment. As they are self-contained, they are also ideally suited for cloud-based deployment.

For additional “production ready” features, such as health, auditing, and metric REST or JMX end-points, consider adding `spring-boot-actuator`. See *[Spring Boot Actuator: Production-ready Features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready)* for details.

### 3.10. What to Read Next

You should now understand how you can use Spring Boot and some best practices that you should follow. You can now go on to learn about specific *[Spring Boot features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features)* in depth, or you could skip ahead and read about the “[production ready](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready)” aspects of Spring Boot.

## 4. Spring Boot Features

This section dives into the details of Spring Boot. Here you can learn about the key features that you may want to use and customize. If you have not already done so, you might want to read the "[Getting Started](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started)" and "[Using Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot)" sections, so that you have a good grounding of the basics.

### 4.1. SpringApplication

The `SpringApplication` class provides a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring application that is started from a `main()` method. In many situations, you can delegate to the static `SpringApplication.run` method, as shown in the following example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MySpringConfiguration.class, args);
}
```

When your application starts, you should see something similar to the following output:

```
  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \

 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::   v2.2.9.RELEASE

2019-04-31 13:09:54.117  INFO 56603 --- [           main] o.s.b.s.app.SampleApplication            : Starting SampleApplication v0.1.0 on mycomputer with PID 56603 (/apps/myapp.jar started by pwebb)

```

By default, `INFO` logging messages are shown, including some relevant startup details, such as the user that launched the application. If you need a log level other than `INFO`, you can set it, as described in [Log Levels](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-log-levels). The application version is determined using the implementation version from the main application class’s package. Startup information logging can be turned off by setting `spring.main.log-startup-info` to `false`. This will also turn off logging of the application’s active profiles.

|      | To add additional logging during startup, you can override `logStartupInfo(boolean)` in a subclass of `SpringApplication`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.1.1. Startup Failure

If your application fails to start, registered `FailureAnalyzers` get a chance to provide a dedicated error message and a concrete action to fix the problem. For instance, if you start a web application on port `8080` and that port is already in use, you should see something similar to the following message:

```
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Embedded servlet container failed to start. Port 8080 was already in use.

Action:

Identify and stop the process that's listening on port 8080 or configure this application to listen on another port.
```

|      | Spring Boot provides numerous `FailureAnalyzer` implementations, and you can [add your own](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-failure-analyzer). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If no failure analyzers are able to handle the exception, you can still display the full conditions report to better understand what went wrong. To do so, you need to [enable the `debug` property](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config) or [enable `DEBUG` logging](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-log-levels) for `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.logging.ConditionEvaluationReportLoggingListener`.

For instance, if you are running your application by using `java -jar`, you can enable the `debug` property as follows:

```
$ java -jar myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --debug
```

#### 4.1.2. Lazy Initialization

`SpringApplication` allows an application to be initialized lazily. When lazy initialization is enabled, beans are created as they are needed rather than during application startup. As a result, enabling lazy initialization can reduce the time that it takes your application to start. In a web application, enabling lazy initialization will result in many web-related beans not being initialized until an HTTP request is received.

A downside of lazy initialization is that it can delay the discovery of a problem with the application. If a misconfigured bean is initialized lazily, a failure will no longer occur during startup and the problem will only become apparent when the bean is initialized. Care must also be taken to ensure that the JVM has sufficient memory to accommodate all of the application’s beans and not just those that are initialized during startup. For these reasons, lazy initialization is not enabled by default and it is recommended that fine-tuning of the JVM’s heap size is done before enabling lazy initialization.

Lazy initialization can be enabled programatically using the `lazyInitialization` method on `SpringApplicationBuilder` or the `setLazyInitialization` method on `SpringApplication`. Alternatively, it can be enabled using the `spring.main.lazy-initialization` property as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true
```

|      | If you want to disable lazy initialization for certain beans while using lazy initialization for the rest of the application, you can explicitly set their lazy attribute to false using the `@Lazy(false)` annotation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.1.3. Customizing the Banner

The banner that is printed on start up can be changed by adding a `banner.txt` file to your classpath or by setting the `spring.banner.location` property to the location of such a file. If the file has an encoding other than UTF-8, you can set `spring.banner.charset`. In addition to a text file, you can also add a `banner.gif`, `banner.jpg`, or `banner.png` image file to your classpath or set the `spring.banner.image.location` property. Images are converted into an ASCII art representation and printed above any text banner.

Inside your `banner.txt` file, you can use any of the following placeholders:

| Variable                                                     | Description                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${application.version}`                                     | The version number of your application, as declared in `MANIFEST.MF`. For example, `Implementation-Version: 1.0` is printed as `1.0`. |
| `${application.formatted-version}`                           | The version number of your application, as declared in `MANIFEST.MF` and formatted for display (surrounded with brackets and prefixed with `v`). For example `(v1.0)`. |
| `${spring-boot.version}`                                     | The Spring Boot version that you are using. For example `2.2.9.RELEASE`. |
| `${spring-boot.formatted-version}`                           | The Spring Boot version that you are using, formatted for display (surrounded with brackets and prefixed with `v`). For example `(v2.2.9.RELEASE)`. |
| `${Ansi.NAME}` (or `${AnsiColor.NAME}`, `${AnsiBackground.NAME}`, `${AnsiStyle.NAME}`) | Where `NAME` is the name of an ANSI escape code. See [`AnsiPropertySource`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/ansi/AnsiPropertySource.java) for details. |
| `${application.title}`                                       | The title of your application, as declared in `MANIFEST.MF`. For example `Implementation-Title: MyApp` is printed as `MyApp`. |

|      | The `SpringApplication.setBanner(…)` method can be used if you want to generate a banner programmatically. Use the `org.springframework.boot.Banner` interface and implement your own `printBanner()` method. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can also use the `spring.main.banner-mode` property to determine if the banner has to be printed on `System.out` (`console`), sent to the configured logger (`log`), or not produced at all (`off`).

The printed banner is registered as a singleton bean under the following name: `springBootBanner`.

#### 4.1.4. Customizing SpringApplication

If the `SpringApplication` defaults are not to your taste, you can instead create a local instance and customize it. For example, to turn off the banner, you could write:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(MySpringConfiguration.class);
    app.setBannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF);
    app.run(args);
}
```

|      | The constructor arguments passed to `SpringApplication` are configuration sources for Spring beans. In most cases, these are references to `@Configuration` classes, but they could also be references to XML configuration or to packages that should be scanned. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

It is also possible to configure the `SpringApplication` by using an `application.properties` file. See *[Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config)* for details.

For a complete list of the configuration options, see the [`SpringApplication` Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html).

#### 4.1.5. Fluent Builder API

If you need to build an `ApplicationContext` hierarchy (multiple contexts with a parent/child relationship) or if you prefer using a “fluent” builder API, you can use the `SpringApplicationBuilder`.

The `SpringApplicationBuilder` lets you chain together multiple method calls and includes `parent` and `child` methods that let you create a hierarchy, as shown in the following example:

```java
new SpringApplicationBuilder()
        .sources(Parent.class)
        .child(Application.class)
        .bannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF)
        .run(args);
```

|      | There are some restrictions when creating an `ApplicationContext` hierarchy. For example, Web components **must** be contained within the child context, and the same `Environment` is used for both parent and child contexts. See the [`SpringApplicationBuilder` Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.html) for full details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.1.6. Application Events and Listeners

In addition to the usual Spring Framework events, such as [`ContextRefreshedEvent`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/ContextRefreshedEvent.html), a `SpringApplication` sends some additional application events.

|      | Some events are actually triggered before the `ApplicationContext` is created, so you cannot register a listener on those as a `@Bean`. You can register them with the `SpringApplication.addListeners(…)` method or the `SpringApplicationBuilder.listeners(…)` method.If you want those listeners to be registered automatically, regardless of the way the application is created, you can add a `META-INF/spring.factories` file to your project and reference your listener(s) by using the `org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener` key, as shown in the following example:`org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener=com.example.project.MyListener` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Application events are sent in the following order, as your application runs:

1. An `ApplicationStartingEvent` is sent at the start of a run but before any processing, except for the registration of listeners and initializers.
2. An `ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent` is sent when the `Environment` to be used in the context is known but before the context is created.
3. An `ApplicationContextInitializedEvent` is sent when the `ApplicationContext` is prepared and ApplicationContextInitializers have been called but before any bean definitions are loaded.
4. An `ApplicationPreparedEvent` is sent just before the refresh is started but after bean definitions have been loaded.
5. An `ApplicationStartedEvent` is sent after the context has been refreshed but before any application and command-line runners have been called.
6. An `ApplicationReadyEvent` is sent after any application and command-line runners have been called. It indicates that the application is ready to service requests.
7. An `ApplicationFailedEvent` is sent if there is an exception on startup.

The above list only includes `SpringApplicationEvent`s that are tied to a `SpringApplication`. In addition to these, the following events are also published after `ApplicationPreparedEvent` and before `ApplicationStartedEvent`:

1. A `ContextRefreshedEvent` is sent when an `ApplicationContext` is refreshed.
2. A `WebServerInitializedEvent` is sent after the `WebServer` is ready. `ServletWebServerInitializedEvent` and `ReactiveWebServerInitializedEvent` are the servlet and reactive variants respectively.

|      | You often need not use application events, but it can be handy to know that they exist. Internally, Spring Boot uses events to handle a variety of tasks. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Application events are sent by using Spring Framework’s event publishing mechanism. Part of this mechanism ensures that an event published to the listeners in a child context is also published to the listeners in any ancestor contexts. As a result of this, if your application uses a hierarchy of `SpringApplication` instances, a listener may receive multiple instances of the same type of application event.

To allow your listener to distinguish between an event for its context and an event for a descendant context, it should request that its application context is injected and then compare the injected context with the context of the event. The context can be injected by implementing `ApplicationContextAware` or, if the listener is a bean, by using `@Autowired`.

#### 4.1.7. Web Environment

A `SpringApplication` attempts to create the right type of `ApplicationContext` on your behalf. The algorithm used to determine a `WebApplicationType` is the following:

- If Spring MVC is present, an `AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext` is used
- If Spring MVC is not present and Spring WebFlux is present, an `AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext` is used
- Otherwise, `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` is used

This means that if you are using Spring MVC and the new `WebClient` from Spring WebFlux in the same application, Spring MVC will be used by default. You can override that easily by calling `setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType)`.

It is also possible to take complete control of the `ApplicationContext` type that is used by calling `setApplicationContextClass(…)`.

|      | It is often desirable to call `setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.NONE)` when using `SpringApplication` within a JUnit test. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.1.8. Accessing Application Arguments

If you need to access the application arguments that were passed to `SpringApplication.run(…)`, you can inject a `org.springframework.boot.ApplicationArguments` bean. The `ApplicationArguments` interface provides access to both the raw `String[]` arguments as well as parsed `option` and `non-option` arguments, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.stereotype.*;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(ApplicationArguments args) {
        boolean debug = args.containsOption("debug");
        List<String> files = args.getNonOptionArgs();
        // if run with "--debug logfile.txt" debug=true, files=["logfile.txt"]
    }

}
```

|      | Spring Boot also registers a `CommandLinePropertySource` with the Spring `Environment`. This lets you also inject single application arguments by using the `@Value` annotation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.1.9. Using the ApplicationRunner or CommandLineRunner

If you need to run some specific code once the `SpringApplication` has started, you can implement the `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner` interfaces. Both interfaces work in the same way and offer a single `run` method, which is called just before `SpringApplication.run(…)` completes.

The `CommandLineRunner` interfaces provides access to application arguments as a string array, whereas the `ApplicationRunner` uses the `ApplicationArguments` interface discussed earlier. The following example shows a `CommandLineRunner` with a `run` method:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.stereotype.*;

@Component
public class MyBean implements CommandLineRunner {

    public void run(String... args) {
        // Do something...
    }

}
```

If several `CommandLineRunner` or `ApplicationRunner` beans are defined that must be called in a specific order, you can additionally implement the `org.springframework.core.Ordered` interface or use the `org.springframework.core.annotation.Order` annotation.

#### 4.1.10. Application Exit

Each `SpringApplication` registers a shutdown hook with the JVM to ensure that the `ApplicationContext` closes gracefully on exit. All the standard Spring lifecycle callbacks (such as the `DisposableBean` interface or the `@PreDestroy` annotation) can be used.

In addition, beans may implement the `org.springframework.boot.ExitCodeGenerator` interface if they wish to return a specific exit code when `SpringApplication.exit()` is called. This exit code can then be passed to `System.exit()` to return it as a status code, as shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ExitCodeApplication {

    @Bean
    public ExitCodeGenerator exitCodeGenerator() {
        return () -> 42;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.exit(SpringApplication.exit(SpringApplication.run(ExitCodeApplication.class, args)));
    }

}
```

Also, the `ExitCodeGenerator` interface may be implemented by exceptions. When such an exception is encountered, Spring Boot returns the exit code provided by the implemented `getExitCode()` method.

#### 4.1.11. Admin Features

It is possible to enable admin-related features for the application by specifying the `spring.application.admin.enabled` property. This exposes the [`SpringApplicationAdminMXBean`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/admin/SpringApplicationAdminMXBean.java) on the platform `MBeanServer`. You could use this feature to administer your Spring Boot application remotely. This feature could also be useful for any service wrapper implementation.

|      | If you want to know on which HTTP port the application is running, get the property with a key of `local.server.port`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 4.2. Externalized Configuration

Spring Boot lets you externalize your configuration so that you can work with the same application code in different environments. You can use properties files, YAML files, environment variables, and command-line arguments to externalize configuration. Property values can be injected directly into your beans by using the `@Value` annotation, accessed through Spring’s `Environment` abstraction, or be [bound to structured objects](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-typesafe-configuration-properties) through `@ConfigurationProperties`.

Spring Boot uses a very particular `PropertySource` order that is designed to allow sensible overriding of values. Properties are considered in the following order:

1. [Devtools global settings properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-globalsettings) in the `$HOME/.config/spring-boot` folder when devtools is active.
2. [`@TestPropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/TestPropertySource.html) annotations on your tests.
3. `properties` attribute on your tests. Available on [`@SpringBootTest`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/test/context/SpringBootTest.html) and the [test annotations for testing a particular slice of your application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-tests).
4. Command line arguments.
5. Properties from `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` (inline JSON embedded in an environment variable or system property).
6. `ServletConfig` init parameters.
7. `ServletContext` init parameters.
8. JNDI attributes from `java:comp/env`.
9. Java System properties (`System.getProperties()`).
10. OS environment variables.
11. A `RandomValuePropertySource` that has properties only in `random.*`.
12. [Profile-specific application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-profile-specific-properties) outside of your packaged jar (`application-{profile}.properties` and YAML variants).
13. [Profile-specific application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-profile-specific-properties) packaged inside your jar (`application-{profile}.properties` and YAML variants).
14. [Application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files) outside of your packaged jar (`application.properties` and YAML variants).
15. [Application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files) packaged inside your jar (`application.properties` and YAML variants).
16. [`@PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html) annotations on your `@Configuration` classes. Please note that such property sources are not added to the `Environment` until the application context is being refreshed. This is too late to configure certain properties such as `logging.*` and `spring.main.*` which are read before refresh begins.
17. Default properties (specified by setting `SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties`).

To provide a concrete example, suppose you develop a `@Component` that uses a `name` property, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Value("${name}")
    private String name;

    // ...

}
```

On your application classpath (for example, inside your jar) you can have an `application.properties` file that provides a sensible default property value for `name`. When running in a new environment, an `application.properties` file can be provided outside of your jar that overrides the `name`. For one-off testing, you can launch with a specific command line switch (for example, `java -jar app.jar --name="Spring"`).

|      | The `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` properties can be supplied on the command line with an environment variable. For example, you could use the following line in a UN*X shell:`$ SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON='{"acme":{"name":"test"}}' java -jar myapp.jar`In the preceding example, you end up with `acme.name=test` in the Spring `Environment`. You can also supply the JSON as `spring.application.json` in a System property, as shown in the following example:`$ java -Dspring.application.json='{"name":"test"}' -jar myapp.jar`You can also supply the JSON by using a command line argument, as shown in the following example:`$ java -jar myapp.jar --spring.application.json='{"name":"test"}'`You can also supply the JSON as a JNDI variable, as follows: `java:comp/env/spring.application.json`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.2.1. Configuring Random Values

The `RandomValuePropertySource` is useful for injecting random values (for example, into secrets or test cases). It can produce integers, longs, uuids, or strings, as shown in the following example:

```properties
my.secret=${random.value}
my.number=${random.int}
my.bignumber=${random.long}
my.uuid=${random.uuid}
my.number.less.than.ten=${random.int(10)}
my.number.in.range=${random.int[1024,65536]}
```

The `random.int*` syntax is `OPEN value (,max) CLOSE` where the `OPEN,CLOSE` are any character and `value,max` are integers. If `max` is provided, then `value` is the minimum value and `max` is the maximum value (exclusive).

#### 4.2.2. Accessing Command Line Properties

By default, `SpringApplication` converts any command line option arguments (that is, arguments starting with `--`, such as `--server.port=9000`) to a `property` and adds them to the Spring `Environment`. As mentioned previously, command line properties always take precedence over other property sources.

If you do not want command line properties to be added to the `Environment`, you can disable them by using `SpringApplication.setAddCommandLineProperties(false)`.

#### 4.2.3. Application Property Files

`SpringApplication` loads properties from `application.properties` files in the following locations and adds them to the Spring `Environment`:

1. A `/config` subdirectory of the current directory
2. The current directory
3. A classpath `/config` package
4. The classpath root

The list is ordered by precedence (properties defined in locations higher in the list override those defined in lower locations).

|      | You can also [use YAML ('.yml') files](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-yaml) as an alternative to '.properties'. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you do not like `application.properties` as the configuration file name, you can switch to another file name by specifying a `spring.config.name` environment property. You can also refer to an explicit location by using the `spring.config.location` environment property (which is a comma-separated list of directory locations or file paths). The following example shows how to specify a different file name:

```
$ java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.name=myproject
```

The following example shows how to specify two locations:

```
$ java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.location=classpath:/default.properties,classpath:/override.properties
```

|      | `spring.config.name` and `spring.config.location` are used very early to determine which files have to be loaded. They must be defined as an environment property (typically an OS environment variable, a system property, or a command-line argument). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If `spring.config.location` contains directories (as opposed to files), they should end in `/` (and, at runtime, be appended with the names generated from `spring.config.name` before being loaded, including profile-specific file names). Files specified in `spring.config.location` are used as-is, with no support for profile-specific variants, and are overridden by any profile-specific properties.

Config locations are searched in reverse order. By default, the configured locations are `classpath:/,classpath:/config/,file:./,file:./config/`. The resulting search order is the following:

1. `file:./config/`
2. `file:./`
3. `classpath:/config/`
4. `classpath:/`

When custom config locations are configured by using `spring.config.location`, they replace the default locations. For example, if `spring.config.location` is configured with the value `classpath:/custom-config/,file:./custom-config/`, the search order becomes the following:

1. `file:./custom-config/`
2. `classpath:custom-config/`

Alternatively, when custom config locations are configured by using `spring.config.additional-location`, they are used in addition to the default locations. Additional locations are searched before the default locations. For example, if additional locations of `classpath:/custom-config/,file:./custom-config/` are configured, the search order becomes the following:

1. `file:./custom-config/`
2. `classpath:custom-config/`
3. `file:./config/`
4. `file:./`
5. `classpath:/config/`
6. `classpath:/`

This search ordering lets you specify default values in one configuration file and then selectively override those values in another. You can provide default values for your application in `application.properties` (or whatever other basename you choose with `spring.config.name`) in one of the default locations. These default values can then be overridden at runtime with a different file located in one of the custom locations.

|      | If you use environment variables rather than system properties, most operating systems disallow period-separated key names, but you can use underscores instead (for example, `SPRING_CONFIG_NAME` instead of `spring.config.name`). See [Binding from Environment Variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding-from-environment-variables) for details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If your application runs in a container, then JNDI properties (in `java:comp/env`) or servlet context initialization parameters can be used instead of, or as well as, environment variables or system properties. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.2.4. Profile-specific Properties

In addition to `application.properties` files, profile-specific properties can also be defined by using the following naming convention: `application-{profile}.properties`. The `Environment` has a set of default profiles (by default, `[default]`) that are used if no active profiles are set. In other words, if no profiles are explicitly activated, then properties from `application-default.properties` are loaded.

Profile-specific properties are loaded from the same locations as standard `application.properties`, with profile-specific files always overriding the non-specific ones, whether or not the profile-specific files are inside or outside your packaged jar.

If several profiles are specified, a last-wins strategy applies. For example, profiles specified by the `spring.profiles.active` property are added after those configured through the `SpringApplication` API and therefore take precedence.

|      | If you have specified any files in `spring.config.location`, profile-specific variants of those files are not considered. Use directories in `spring.config.location` if you want to also use profile-specific properties. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.2.5. Placeholders in Properties

The values in `application.properties` are filtered through the existing `Environment` when they are used, so you can refer back to previously defined values (for example, from System properties).

```properties
app.name=MyApp
app.description=${app.name} is a Spring Boot application
```

|      | You can also use this technique to create “short” variants of existing Spring Boot properties. See the *[Use ‘Short’ Command Line Arguments](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-short-command-line-arguments)* how-to for details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.2.6. Encrypting Properties

Spring Boot does not provide any built in support for encrypting property values, however, it does provide the hook points necessary to modify values contained in the Spring `Environment`. The `EnvironmentPostProcessor` interface allows you to manipulate the `Environment` before the application starts. See [Customize the Environment or ApplicationContext Before It Starts](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-customize-the-environment-or-application-context) for details.

If you’re looking for a secure way to store credentials and passwords, the [Spring Cloud Vault](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/) project provides support for storing externalized configuration in [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

#### 4.2.7. Using YAML Instead of Properties

[YAML](https://yaml.org/) is a superset of JSON and, as such, is a convenient format for specifying hierarchical configuration data. The `SpringApplication` class automatically supports YAML as an alternative to properties whenever you have the [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml) library on your classpath.

|      | If you use “Starters”, SnakeYAML is automatically provided by `spring-boot-starter`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Loading YAML

Spring Framework provides two convenient classes that can be used to load YAML documents. The `YamlPropertiesFactoryBean` loads YAML as `Properties` and the `YamlMapFactoryBean` loads YAML as a `Map`.

For example, consider the following YAML document:

```yaml
environments:
    dev:
        url: https://dev.example.com
        name: Developer Setup
    prod:
        url: https://another.example.com
        name: My Cool App
```

The preceding example would be transformed into the following properties:

```properties
environments.dev.url=https://dev.example.com
environments.dev.name=Developer Setup
environments.prod.url=https://another.example.com
environments.prod.name=My Cool App
```

YAML lists are represented as property keys with `[index]` dereferencers. For example, consider the following YAML:

```yaml
my:
   servers:
       - dev.example.com
       - another.example.com
```

The preceding example would be transformed into these properties:

```properties
my.servers[0]=dev.example.com
my.servers[1]=another.example.com
```

To bind to properties like that by using Spring Boot’s `Binder` utilities (which is what `@ConfigurationProperties` does), you need to have a property in the target bean of type `java.util.List` (or `Set`) and you either need to provide a setter or initialize it with a mutable value. For example, the following example binds to the properties shown previously:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="my")
public class Config {

    private List<String> servers = new ArrayList<String>();

    public List<String> getServers() {
        return this.servers;
    }
}
```

##### Exposing YAML as Properties in the Spring Environment

The `YamlPropertySourceLoader` class can be used to expose YAML as a `PropertySource` in the Spring `Environment`. Doing so lets you use the `@Value` annotation with placeholders syntax to access YAML properties.

##### Multi-profile YAML Documents

You can specify multiple profile-specific YAML documents in a single file by using a `spring.profiles` key to indicate when the document applies, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
server:
    address: 192.168.1.100
---
spring:
    profiles: development
server:
    address: 127.0.0.1
---
spring:
    profiles: production & eu-central
server:
    address: 192.168.1.120
```

In the preceding example, if the `development` profile is active, the `server.address` property is `127.0.0.1`. Similarly, if the `production` **and** `eu-central` profiles are active, the `server.address` property is `192.168.1.120`. If the `development`, `production` and `eu-central` profiles are **not** enabled, then the value for the property is `192.168.1.100`.

|      | `spring.profiles` can therefore contain a profile name (for example `production`) or a profile expression. A profile expression allows for more complicated profile logic to be expressed, for example `production & (eu-central | eu-west)`. Check the [reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition-profiles-java) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If none are explicitly active when the application context starts, the default profiles are activated. So, in the following YAML, we set a value for `spring.security.user.password` that is available **only** in the "default" profile:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8000
---
spring:
  profiles: default
  security:
    user:
      password: weak
```

Whereas, in the following example, the password is always set because it is not attached to any profile, and it would have to be explicitly reset in all other profiles as necessary:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8000
spring:
  security:
    user:
      password: weak
```

Spring profiles designated by using the `spring.profiles` element may optionally be negated by using the `!` character. If both negated and non-negated profiles are specified for a single document, at least one non-negated profile must match, and no negated profiles may match.

##### YAML Shortcomings

YAML files cannot be loaded by using the `@PropertySource` annotation. So, in the case that you need to load values that way, you need to use a properties file.

Using the multi YAML document syntax in profile-specific YAML files can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, consider the following config in a file:

application-dev.yml

```yaml
server:
  port: 8000
---
spring:
  profiles: "!test"
  security:
    user:
      password: "secret"
```

If you run the application with the argument `--spring.profiles.active=dev` you might expect `security.user.password` to be set to “secret”, but this is not the case.

The nested document will be filtered because the main file is named `application-dev.yml`. It is already considered to be profile-specific, and nested documents will be ignored.

|      | We recommend that you don’t mix profile-specific YAML files and multiple YAML documents. Stick to using only one of them. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.2.8. Type-safe Configuration Properties

Using the `@Value("${property}")` annotation to inject configuration properties can sometimes be cumbersome, especially if you are working with multiple properties or your data is hierarchical in nature. Spring Boot provides an alternative method of working with properties that lets strongly typed beans govern and validate the configuration of your application.

|      | See also the [differences between `@Value` and type-safe configuration properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-vs-value). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### JavaBean properties binding

It is possible to bind a bean declaring standard JavaBean properties as shown in the following example:

```java
package com.example;

import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    private boolean enabled;

    private InetAddress remoteAddress;

    private final Security security = new Security();

    public boolean isEnabled() { ... }

    public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) { ... }

    public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() { ... }

    public void setRemoteAddress(InetAddress remoteAddress) { ... }

    public Security getSecurity() { ... }

    public static class Security {

        private String username;

        private String password;

        private List<String> roles = new ArrayList<>(Collections.singleton("USER"));

        public String getUsername() { ... }

        public void setUsername(String username) { ... }

        public String getPassword() { ... }

        public void setPassword(String password) { ... }

        public List<String> getRoles() { ... }

        public void setRoles(List<String> roles) { ... }

    }
}
```

The preceding POJO defines the following properties:

- `acme.enabled`, with a value of `false` by default.
- `acme.remote-address`, with a type that can be coerced from `String`.
- `acme.security.username`, with a nested "security" object whose name is determined by the name of the property. In particular, the return type is not used at all there and could have been `SecurityProperties`.
- `acme.security.password`.
- `acme.security.roles`, with a collection of `String` that defaults to `USER`.

|      | The properties that map to `@ConfigurationProperties` classes available in Spring Boot, which are configured via properties files, YAML files, environment variables etc., are public API but the accessors (getters/setters) of the class itself are not meant to be used directly. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Such arrangement relies on a default empty constructor and getters and setters are usually mandatory, since binding is through standard Java Beans property descriptors, just like in Spring MVC. A setter may be omitted in the following cases:Maps, as long as they are initialized, need a getter but not necessarily a setter, since they can be mutated by the binder.Collections and arrays can be accessed either through an index (typically with YAML) or by using a single comma-separated value (properties). In the latter case, a setter is mandatory. We recommend to always add a setter for such types. If you initialize a collection, make sure it is not immutable (as in the preceding example).If nested POJO properties are initialized (like the `Security` field in the preceding example), a setter is not required. If you want the binder to create the instance on the fly by using its default constructor, you need a setter.Some people use Project Lombok to add getters and setters automatically. Make sure that Lombok does not generate any particular constructor for such a type, as it is used automatically by the container to instantiate the object.Finally, only standard Java Bean properties are considered and binding on static properties is not supported. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Constructor binding

The example in the previous section can be rewritten in an immutable fashion as shown in the following example:

```java
package com.example;

import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConstructorBinding;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.DefaultValue;

@ConstructorBinding
@ConfigurationProperties("acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    private final boolean enabled;

    private final InetAddress remoteAddress;

    private final Security security;

    public AcmeProperties(boolean enabled, InetAddress remoteAddress, Security security) {
        this.enabled = enabled;
        this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
        this.security = security;
    }

    public boolean isEnabled() { ... }

    public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() { ... }

    public Security getSecurity() { ... }

    public static class Security {

        private final String username;

        private final String password;

        private final List<String> roles;

        public Security(String username, String password,
                @DefaultValue("USER") List<String> roles) {
            this.username = username;
            this.password = password;
            this.roles = roles;
        }

        public String getUsername() { ... }

        public String getPassword() { ... }

        public List<String> getRoles() { ... }

    }

}
```

In this setup, the `@ConstructorBinding` annotation is used to indicate that constructor binding should be used. This means that the binder will expect to find a constructor with the parameters that you wish to have bound.

Nested members of a `@ConstructorBinding` class (such as `Security` in the example above) will also be bound via their constructor.

Default values can be specified using `@DefaultValue` and the same conversion service will be applied to coerce the `String` value to the target type of a missing property. By default, if no properties are bound to `Security`, the `AcmeProperties` instance will contain a `null` value for `security`. If you wish you return a non-null instance of `Security` even when no properties are bound to it, you can use an empty `@DefaultValue` annotation to do so:

```java
package com.example;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConstructorBinding;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.DefaultValue;

@ConstructorBinding
@ConfigurationProperties("acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    private final boolean enabled;

    private final InetAddress remoteAddress;

    private final Security security;

    public AcmeProperties(boolean enabled, InetAddress remoteAddress, @DefaultValue Security security) {
        this.enabled = enabled;
        this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
        this.security = security;
    }
}
```

|      | To use constructor binding the class must be enabled using `@EnableConfigurationProperties` or configuration property scanning. You cannot use constructor binding with beans that are created by the regular Spring mechanisms (e.g. `@Component` beans, beans created via `@Bean` methods or beans loaded using `@Import`) |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you have more than one constructor for your class you can also use `@ConstructorBinding` directly on the constructor that should be bound. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Enabling `@ConfigurationProperties`-annotated types

Spring Boot provides infrastructure to bind `@ConfigurationProperties` types and register them as beans. You can either enable configuration properties on a class-by-class basis or enable configuration property scanning that works in a similar manner to component scanning.

Sometimes, classes annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` might not be suitable for scanning, for example, if you’re developing your own auto-configuration or you want to enable them conditionally. In these cases, specify the list of types to process using the `@EnableConfigurationProperties` annotation. This can be done on any `@Configuration` class, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableConfigurationProperties(AcmeProperties.class)
public class MyConfiguration {
}
```

To use configuration property scanning, add the `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan` annotation to your application. Typically, it is added to the main application class that is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` but it can be added to any `@Configuration` class. By default, scanning will occur from the package of the class that declares the annotation. If you want to define specific packages to scan, you can do so as shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@ConfigurationPropertiesScan({ "com.example.app", "org.acme.another" })
public class MyApplication {
}
```

|      | When the `@ConfigurationProperties` bean is registered using configuration property scanning or via `@EnableConfigurationProperties`, the bean has a conventional name: `-`, where `` is the environment key prefix specified in the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation and `` is the fully qualified name of the bean. If the annotation does not provide any prefix, only the fully qualified name of the bean is used.The bean name in the example above is `acme-com.example.AcmeProperties`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

We recommend that `@ConfigurationProperties` only deal with the environment and, in particular, does not inject other beans from the context. For corner cases, setter injection can be used or any of the `*Aware` interfaces provided by the framework (such as `EnvironmentAware` if you need access to the `Environment`). If you still want to inject other beans using the constructor, the configuration properties bean must be annotated with `@Component` and use JavaBean-based property binding.

##### Using `@ConfigurationProperties`-annotated types

This style of configuration works particularly well with the `SpringApplication` external YAML configuration, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
# application.yml

acme:
    remote-address: 192.168.1.1
    security:
        username: admin
        roles:
          - USER
          - ADMIN

# additional configuration as required
```

To work with `@ConfigurationProperties` beans, you can inject them in the same way as any other bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final AcmeProperties properties;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(AcmeProperties properties) {
        this.properties = properties;
    }

    //...

    @PostConstruct
    public void openConnection() {
        Server server = new Server(this.properties.getRemoteAddress());
        // ...
    }

}
```

|      | Using `@ConfigurationProperties` also lets you generate metadata files that can be used by IDEs to offer auto-completion for your own keys. See the [appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata) for details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Third-party Configuration

As well as using `@ConfigurationProperties` to annotate a class, you can also use it on public `@Bean` methods. Doing so can be particularly useful when you want to bind properties to third-party components that are outside of your control.

To configure a bean from the `Environment` properties, add `@ConfigurationProperties` to its bean registration, as shown in the following example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "another")
@Bean
public AnotherComponent anotherComponent() {
    ...
}
```

Any JavaBean property defined with the `another` prefix is mapped onto that `AnotherComponent` bean in manner similar to the preceding `AcmeProperties` example.

##### Relaxed Binding

Spring Boot uses some relaxed rules for binding `Environment` properties to `@ConfigurationProperties` beans, so there does not need to be an exact match between the `Environment` property name and the bean property name. Common examples where this is useful include dash-separated environment properties (for example, `context-path` binds to `contextPath`), and capitalized environment properties (for example, `PORT` binds to `port`).

As an example, consider the following `@ConfigurationProperties` class:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="acme.my-project.person")
public class OwnerProperties {

    private String firstName;

    public String getFirstName() {
        return this.firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

}
```

With the preceding code, the following properties names can all be used:

| Property                            | Note                                                         |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acme.my-project.person.first-name` | Kebab case, which is recommended for use in `.properties` and `.yml` files. |
| `acme.myProject.person.firstName`   | Standard camel case syntax.                                  |
| `acme.my_project.person.first_name` | Underscore notation, which is an alternative format for use in `.properties` and `.yml` files. |
| `ACME_MYPROJECT_PERSON_FIRSTNAME`   | Upper case format, which is recommended when using system environment variables. |

|      | The `prefix` value for the annotation *must* be in kebab case (lowercase and separated by `-`, such as `acme.my-project.person`). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

| Property Source       | Simple                                                       | List                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Properties Files      | Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation               | Standard list syntax using `[ ]` or comma-separated values   |
| YAML Files            | Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation               | Standard YAML list syntax or comma-separated values          |
| Environment Variables | Upper case format with underscore as the delimiter (see [Binding from Environment Variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding-from-environment-variables)). | Numeric values surrounded by underscores (see [Binding from Environment Variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding-from-environment-variables))` |
| System properties     | Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation               | Standard list syntax using `[ ]` or comma-separated values   |

|      | We recommend that, when possible, properties are stored in lower-case kebab format, such as `my.property-name=acme`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Binding Maps

When binding to `Map` properties, if the `key` contains anything other than lowercase alpha-numeric characters or `-`, you need to use the bracket notation so that the original value is preserved. If the key is not surrounded by `[]`, any characters that are not alpha-numeric or `-` are removed. For example, consider binding the following properties to a `Map`:

```yaml
acme:
  map:
    "[/key1]": value1
    "[/key2]": value2
    /key3: value3
```

The properties above will bind to a `Map` with `/key1`, `/key2` and `key3` as the keys in the map.

|      | For YAML files, the brackets need to be surrounded by quotes for the keys to be parsed properly. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Binding from Environment Variables

Most operating systems impose strict rules around the names that can be used for environment variables. For example, Linux shell variables can contain only letters (`a` to `z` or `A` to `Z`), numbers (`0` to `9`) or the underscore character (`_`). By convention, Unix shell variables will also have their names in UPPERCASE.

Spring Boot’s relaxed binding rules are, as much as possible, designed to be compatible with these naming restrictions.

To convert a property name in the canonical-form to an environment variable name you can follow these rules:

- Replace dots (`.`) with underscores (`_`).
- Remove any dashes (`-`).
- Convert to uppercase.

For example, the configuration property `spring.main.log-startup-info` would be an environment variable named `SPRING_MAIN_LOGSTARTUPINFO`.

|      | Underscores cannot be used to replace the dashes in property names. If you attempt to use `SPRING_MAIN_LOG_STARTUP_INFO` with the example above, no value will be bound. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Environment variables can also be used when binding to object lists. To bind to a `List`, the element number should be surrounded with underscores in the variable name.

For example, the configuration property `my.acme[0].other` would use an environment variable named `MY_ACME_0_OTHER`.

##### Merging Complex Types

When lists are configured in more than one place, overriding works by replacing the entire list.

For example, assume a `MyPojo` object with `name` and `description` attributes that are `null` by default. The following example exposes a list of `MyPojo` objects from `AcmeProperties`:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    private final List<MyPojo> list = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<MyPojo> getList() {
        return this.list;
    }

}
```

Consider the following configuration:

```yaml
acme:
  list:
    - name: my name
      description: my description
---
spring:
  profiles: dev
acme:
  list:
    - name: my another name
```

If the `dev` profile is not active, `AcmeProperties.list` contains one `MyPojo` entry, as previously defined. If the `dev` profile is enabled, however, the `list` *still* contains only one entry (with a name of `my another name` and a description of `null`). This configuration *does not* add a second `MyPojo` instance to the list, and it does not merge the items.

When a `List` is specified in multiple profiles, the one with the highest priority (and only that one) is used. Consider the following example:

```yaml
acme:
  list:
    - name: my name
      description: my description
    - name: another name
      description: another description
---
spring:
  profiles: dev
acme:
  list:
    - name: my another name
```

In the preceding example, if the `dev` profile is active, `AcmeProperties.list` contains *one* `MyPojo` entry (with a name of `my another name` and a description of `null`). For YAML, both comma-separated lists and YAML lists can be used for completely overriding the contents of the list.

For `Map` properties, you can bind with property values drawn from multiple sources. However, for the same property in multiple sources, the one with the highest priority is used. The following example exposes a `Map` from `AcmeProperties`:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    private final Map<String, MyPojo> map = new HashMap<>();

    public Map<String, MyPojo> getMap() {
        return this.map;
    }

}
```

Consider the following configuration:

```yaml
acme:
  map:
    key1:
      name: my name 1
      description: my description 1
---
spring:
  profiles: dev
acme:
  map:
    key1:
      name: dev name 1
    key2:
      name: dev name 2
      description: dev description 2
```

If the `dev` profile is not active, `AcmeProperties.map` contains one entry with key `key1` (with a name of `my name 1` and a description of `my description 1`). If the `dev` profile is enabled, however, `map` contains two entries with keys `key1` (with a name of `dev name 1` and a description of `my description 1`) and `key2` (with a name of `dev name 2` and a description of `dev description 2`).

|      | The preceding merging rules apply to properties from all property sources and not just YAML files. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Properties Conversion

Spring Boot attempts to coerce the external application properties to the right type when it binds to the `@ConfigurationProperties` beans. If you need custom type conversion, you can provide a `ConversionService` bean (with a bean named `conversionService`) or custom property editors (through a `CustomEditorConfigurer` bean) or custom `Converters` (with bean definitions annotated as `@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding`).

|      | As this bean is requested very early during the application lifecycle, make sure to limit the dependencies that your `ConversionService` is using. Typically, any dependency that you require may not be fully initialized at creation time. You may want to rename your custom `ConversionService` if it is not required for configuration keys coercion and only rely on custom converters qualified with `@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Converting durations

Spring Boot has dedicated support for expressing durations. If you expose a `java.time.Duration` property, the following formats in application properties are available:

- A regular `long` representation (using milliseconds as the default unit unless a `@DurationUnit` has been specified)
- The standard ISO-8601 format [used by `java.time.Duration`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api//java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-)
- A more readable format where the value and the unit are coupled (e.g. `10s` means 10 seconds)

Consider the following example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("app.system")
public class AppSystemProperties {

    @DurationUnit(ChronoUnit.SECONDS)
    private Duration sessionTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(30);

    private Duration readTimeout = Duration.ofMillis(1000);

    public Duration getSessionTimeout() {
        return this.sessionTimeout;
    }

    public void setSessionTimeout(Duration sessionTimeout) {
        this.sessionTimeout = sessionTimeout;
    }

    public Duration getReadTimeout() {
        return this.readTimeout;
    }

    public void setReadTimeout(Duration readTimeout) {
        this.readTimeout = readTimeout;
    }

}
```

To specify a session timeout of 30 seconds, `30`, `PT30S` and `30s` are all equivalent. A read timeout of 500ms can be specified in any of the following form: `500`, `PT0.5S` and `500ms`.

You can also use any of the supported units. These are:

- `ns` for nanoseconds
- `us` for microseconds
- `ms` for milliseconds
- `s` for seconds
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours
- `d` for days

The default unit is milliseconds and can be overridden using `@DurationUnit` as illustrated in the sample above.

|      | If you are upgrading from a previous version that is using `Long` to express the duration, make sure to define the unit (using `@DurationUnit`) if it isn’t milliseconds alongside the switch to `Duration`. Doing so gives a transparent upgrade path while supporting a much richer format. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Converting Data Sizes

Spring Framework has a `DataSize` value type that expresses a size in bytes. If you expose a `DataSize` property, the following formats in application properties are available:

- A regular `long` representation (using bytes as the default unit unless a `@DataSizeUnit` has been specified)
- A more readable format where the value and the unit are coupled (e.g. `10MB` means 10 megabytes)

Consider the following example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("app.io")
public class AppIoProperties {

    @DataSizeUnit(DataUnit.MEGABYTES)
    private DataSize bufferSize = DataSize.ofMegabytes(2);

    private DataSize sizeThreshold = DataSize.ofBytes(512);

    public DataSize getBufferSize() {
        return this.bufferSize;
    }

    public void setBufferSize(DataSize bufferSize) {
        this.bufferSize = bufferSize;
    }

    public DataSize getSizeThreshold() {
        return this.sizeThreshold;
    }

    public void setSizeThreshold(DataSize sizeThreshold) {
        this.sizeThreshold = sizeThreshold;
    }

}
```

To specify a buffer size of 10 megabytes, `10` and `10MB` are equivalent. A size threshold of 256 bytes can be specified as `256` or `256B`.

You can also use any of the supported units. These are:

- `B` for bytes
- `KB` for kilobytes
- `MB` for megabytes
- `GB` for gigabytes
- `TB` for terabytes

The default unit is bytes and can be overridden using `@DataSizeUnit` as illustrated in the sample above.

|      | If you are upgrading from a previous version that is using `Long` to express the size, make sure to define the unit (using `@DataSizeUnit`) if it isn’t bytes alongsidethe switch to `DataSize`. Doing so gives a transparent upgrade path while supporting a much richer format. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### @ConfigurationProperties Validation

Spring Boot attempts to validate `@ConfigurationProperties` classes whenever they are annotated with Spring’s `@Validated` annotation. You can use JSR-303 `javax.validation` constraint annotations directly on your configuration class. To do so, ensure that a compliant JSR-303 implementation is on your classpath and then add constraint annotations to your fields, as shown in the following example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="acme")
@Validated
public class AcmeProperties {

    @NotNull
    private InetAddress remoteAddress;

    // ... getters and setters

}
```

|      | You can also trigger validation by annotating the `@Bean` method that creates the configuration properties with `@Validated`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To ensure that validation is always triggered for nested properties, even when no properties are found, the associated field must be annotated with `@Valid`. The following example builds on the preceding `AcmeProperties` example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="acme")
@Validated
public class AcmeProperties {

    @NotNull
    private InetAddress remoteAddress;

    @Valid
    private final Security security = new Security();

    // ... getters and setters

    public static class Security {

        @NotEmpty
        public String username;

        // ... getters and setters

    }

}
```

You can also add a custom Spring `Validator` by creating a bean definition called `configurationPropertiesValidator`. The `@Bean` method should be declared `static`. The configuration properties validator is created very early in the application’s lifecycle, and declaring the `@Bean` method as static lets the bean be created without having to instantiate the `@Configuration` class. Doing so avoids any problems that may be caused by early instantiation.

|      | The `spring-boot-actuator` module includes an endpoint that exposes all `@ConfigurationProperties` beans. Point your web browser to `/actuator/configprops` or use the equivalent JMX endpoint. See the "[Production ready features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints)" section for details. |

|      |                                                              |

##### @ConfigurationProperties vs. @Value

The `@Value` annotation is a core container feature, and it does not provide the same features as type-safe configuration properties. The following table summarizes the features that are supported by `@ConfigurationProperties` and `@Value`:

| Feature                                                      | `@ConfigurationProperties` | `@Value`                 |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| [Relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding) | Yes                        | Limited (see note below) |
| [Meta-data support](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata) | Yes                        | No                       |
| `SpEL` evaluation                                            | No                         | Yes                      |

If you define a set of configuration keys for your own components, we recommend you group them in a POJO annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`. Doing so will provide you with structured, type-safe object that you can inject into your own beans.

If you do want to use `@Value`, we recommend that you refer to property names using their canonical form (kebab-case using only lowercase letters). This will allow Spring Boot to use the same logic as it does when relaxed binding `@ConfigurationProperties`. For example, `@Value("{demo.item-price}")` will pick up `demo.item-price` and `demo.itemPrice` forms from the `application.properties` file, as well as `DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment. If you used `@Value("{demo.itemPrice}")` instead, `demo.item-price` and `DEMO_ITEMPRICE` would not be considered.

Finally, while you can write a `SpEL` expression in `@Value`, such expressions are not processed from [application property files](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files).

### 4.3. Profiles

Spring Profiles provide a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it be available only in certain environments. Any `@Component`, `@Configuration` or `@ConfigurationProperties` can be marked with `@Profile` to limit when it is loaded, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@Profile("production")
public class ProductionConfiguration {

    // ...

}
```

|      | If `@ConfigurationProperties` beans are registered via `@EnableConfigurationProperties` instead of automatic scanning, the `@Profile` annotation needs to be specified on the `@Configuration` class that has the `@EnableConfigurationProperties` annotation. In the case where `@ConfigurationProperties` are scanned, `@Profile` can be specified on the `@ConfigurationProperties` class itself. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can use a `spring.profiles.active` `Environment` property to specify which profiles are active. You can specify the property in any of the ways described earlier in this chapter. For example, you could include it in your `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev,hsqldb
```

You could also specify it on the command line by using the following switch: `--spring.profiles.active=dev,hsqldb`.

#### 4.3.1. Adding Active Profiles

The `spring.profiles.active` property follows the same ordering rules as other properties: The highest `PropertySource` wins. This means that you can specify active profiles in `application.properties` and then **replace** them by using the command line switch.

Sometimes, it is useful to have profile-specific properties that **add** to the active profiles rather than replace them. The `spring.profiles.include` property can be used to unconditionally add active profiles. The `SpringApplication` entry point also has a Java API for setting additional profiles (that is, on top of those activated by the `spring.profiles.active` property). See the `setAdditionalProfiles()` method in [SpringApplication](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html).

For example, when an application with the following properties is run by using the switch, `--spring.profiles.active=prod`, the `proddb` and `prodmq` profiles are also activated:

```yaml
---
my.property: fromyamlfile
---
spring.profiles: prod
spring.profiles.include:
  - proddb
  - prodmq
```

|      | Remember that the `spring.profiles` property can be defined in a YAML document to determine when this particular document is included in the configuration. See [Change Configuration Depending on the Environment](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-change-configuration-depending-on-the-environment) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.3.2. Programmatically Setting Profiles

You can programmatically set active profiles by calling `SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles(…)` before your application runs. It is also possible to activate profiles by using Spring’s `ConfigurableEnvironment` interface.

#### 4.3.3. Profile-specific Configuration Files

Profile-specific variants of both `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) and files referenced through `@ConfigurationProperties` are considered as files and loaded. See "[Profile-specific Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-profile-specific-properties)" for details.

### 4.4. Logging

Spring Boot uses [Commons Logging](https://commons.apache.org/logging) for all internal logging but leaves the underlying log implementation open. Default configurations are provided for [Java Util Logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api//java/util/logging/package-summary.html), [Log4J2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), and [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/). In each case, loggers are pre-configured to use console output with optional file output also available.

By default, if you use the “Starters”, Logback is used for logging. Appropriate Logback routing is also included to ensure that dependent libraries that use Java Util Logging, Commons Logging, Log4J, or SLF4J all work correctly.

|      | There are a lot of logging frameworks available for Java. Do not worry if the above list seems confusing. Generally, you do not need to change your logging dependencies and the Spring Boot defaults work just fine. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | When you deploy your application to a servlet container or application server, logging performed via the Java Util Logging API is not routed into your application’s logs. This prevents logging performed by the container or other applications that have been deployed to it from appearing in your application’s logs. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.4.1. Log Format

The default log output from Spring Boot resembles the following example:

```
2019-03-05 10:57:51.112  INFO 45469 --- [           main] org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine  : Starting Servlet Engine: Apache Tomcat/7.0.52
2019-03-05 10:57:51.253  INFO 45469 --- [ost-startStop-1] o.a.c.c.C.[Tomcat].[localhost].[/]       : Initializing Spring embedded WebApplicationContext
2019-03-05 10:57:51.253  INFO 45469 --- [ost-startStop-1] o.s.web.context.ContextLoader            : Root WebApplicationContext: initialization completed in 1358 ms
2019-03-05 10:57:51.698  INFO 45469 --- [ost-startStop-1] o.s.b.c.e.ServletRegistrationBean        : Mapping servlet: 'dispatcherServlet' to [/]
2019-03-05 10:57:51.702  INFO 45469 --- [ost-startStop-1] o.s.b.c.embedded.FilterRegistrationBean  : Mapping filter: 'hiddenHttpMethodFilter' to: [/*]
```

The following items are output:

- Date and Time: Millisecond precision and easily sortable.
- Log Level: `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `TRACE`.
- Process ID.
- A `---` separator to distinguish the start of actual log messages.
- Thread name: Enclosed in square brackets (may be truncated for console output).
- Logger name: This is usually the source class name (often abbreviated).
- The log message.

|      | Logback does not have a `FATAL` level. It is mapped to `ERROR`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.4.2. Console Output

The default log configuration echoes messages to the console as they are written. By default, `ERROR`-level, `WARN`-level, and `INFO`-level messages are logged. You can also enable a “debug” mode by starting your application with a `--debug` flag.

```
$ java -jar myapp.jar --debug
```

|      | You can also specify `debug=true` in your `application.properties`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

When the debug mode is enabled, a selection of core loggers (embedded container, Hibernate, and Spring Boot) are configured to output more information. Enabling the debug mode does *not* configure your application to log all messages with `DEBUG` level.

Alternatively, you can enable a “trace” mode by starting your application with a `--trace` flag (or `trace=true` in your `application.properties`). Doing so enables trace logging for a selection of core loggers (embedded container, Hibernate schema generation, and the whole Spring portfolio).

##### Color-coded Output

If your terminal supports ANSI, color output is used to aid readability. You can set `spring.output.ansi.enabled` to a [supported value](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/ansi/AnsiOutput.Enabled.html) to override the auto-detection.

Color coding is configured by using the `%clr` conversion word. In its simplest form, the converter colors the output according to the log level, as shown in the following example:

```
%clr(%5p)
```

The following table describes the mapping of log levels to colors:

| Level   | Color  |
| :------ | :----- |
| `FATAL` | Red    |
| `ERROR` | Red    |
| `WARN`  | Yellow |
| `INFO`  | Green  |
| `DEBUG` | Green  |
| `TRACE` | Green  |

Alternatively, you can specify the color or style that should be used by providing it as an option to the conversion. For example, to make the text yellow, use the following setting:

```
%clr(%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}){yellow}
```

The following colors and styles are supported:

- `blue`
- `cyan`
- `faint`
- `green`
- `magenta`
- `red`
- `yellow`

#### 4.4.3. File Output

By default, Spring Boot logs only to the console and does not write log files. If you want to write log files in addition to the console output, you need to set a `logging.file.name` or `logging.file.path` property (for example, in your `application.properties`).

The following table shows how the `logging.*` properties can be used together:

| `logging.file.name` | `logging.file.path` | Example    | Description                                                  |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| *(none)*            | *(none)*            |            | Console only logging.                                        |
| Specific file       | *(none)*            | `my.log`   | Writes to the specified log file. Names can be an exact location or relative to the current directory. |
| *(none)*            | Specific directory  | `/var/log` | Writes `spring.log` to the specified directory. Names can be an exact location or relative to the current directory. |

Log files rotate when they reach 10 MB and, as with console output, `ERROR`-level, `WARN`-level, and `INFO`-level messages are logged by default. Size limits can be changed using the `logging.file.max-size` property. Rotated log files of the last 7 days are kept by default unless the `logging.file.max-history` property has been set. The total size of log archives can be capped using `logging.file.total-size-cap`. When the total size of log archives exceeds that threshold, backups will be deleted. To force log archive cleanup on application startup, use the `logging.file.clean-history-on-start` property.

|      | Logging properties are independent of the actual logging infrastructure. As a result, specific configuration keys (such as `logback.configurationFile` for Logback) are not managed by spring Boot. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.4.4. Log Levels

All the supported logging systems can have the logger levels set in the Spring `Environment` (for example, in `application.properties`) by using `logging.level.=` where `level` is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The `root` logger can be configured by using `logging.level.root`.

The following example shows potential logging settings in `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.level.root=warn
logging.level.org.springframework.web=debug
logging.level.org.hibernate=error
```

It’s also possible to set logging levels using environment variables. For example, `LOGGING_LEVEL_ORG_SPRINGFRAMEWORK_WEB=DEBUG` will set `org.springframework.web` to `DEBUG`.

|      | The above approach will only work for package level logging. Since relaxed binding always converts environment variables to lowercase, it’s not possible to configure logging for an individual class in this way. If you need to configure logging for a class, you can use [the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-json) variable. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.4.5. Log Groups

It’s often useful to be able to group related loggers together so that they can all be configured at the same time. For example, you might commonly change the logging levels for *all* Tomcat related loggers, but you can’t easily remember top level packages.

To help with this, Spring Boot allows you to define logging groups in your Spring `Environment`. For example, here’s how you could define a “tomcat” group by adding it to your `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.group.tomcat=org.apache.catalina, org.apache.coyote, org.apache.tomcat
```

Once defined, you can change the level for all the loggers in the group with a single line:

```properties
logging.level.tomcat=TRACE
```

Spring Boot includes the following pre-defined logging groups that can be used out-of-the-box:

| Name | Loggers                                                      |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| web  | `org.springframework.core.codec`, `org.springframework.http`, `org.springframework.web`, `org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.web`, `org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.ServletContextInitializerBeans` |
| sql  | `org.springframework.jdbc.core`, `org.hibernate.SQL`, `org.jooq.tools.LoggerListener` |

#### 4.4.6. Custom Log Configuration

The various logging systems can be activated by including the appropriate libraries on the classpath and can be further customized by providing a suitable configuration file in the root of the classpath or in a location specified by the following Spring `Environment` property: `logging.config`.

You can force Spring Boot to use a particular logging system by using the `org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem` system property. The value should be the fully qualified class name of a `LoggingSystem` implementation. You can also disable Spring Boot’s logging configuration entirely by using a value of `none`.

|      | Since logging is initialized **before** the `ApplicationContext` is created, it is not possible to control logging from `@PropertySources` in Spring `@Configuration` files. The only way to change the logging system or disable it entirely is via System properties. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Depending on your logging system, the following files are loaded:

| Logging System          | Customization                                                |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logback                 | `logback-spring.xml`, `logback-spring.groovy`, `logback.xml`, or `logback.groovy` |
| Log4j2                  | `log4j2-spring.xml` or `log4j2.xml`                          |
| JDK (Java Util Logging) | `logging.properties`                                         |

|      | When possible, we recommend that you use the `-spring` variants for your logging configuration (for example, `logback-spring.xml` rather than `logback.xml`). If you use standard configuration locations, Spring cannot completely control log initialization. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | There are known classloading issues with Java Util Logging that cause problems when running from an 'executable jar'. We recommend that you avoid it when running from an 'executable jar' if at all possible. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To help with the customization, some other properties are transferred from the Spring `Environment` to System properties, as described in the following table:

| Spring Environment                    | System Property                   | Comments                                                     |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `logging.exception-conversion-word`   | `LOG_EXCEPTION_CONVERSION_WORD`   | The conversion word used when logging exceptions.            |
| `logging.file.clean-history-on-start` | `LOG_FILE_CLEAN_HISTORY_ON_START` | Whether to clean the archive log files on startup (if LOG_FILE enabled). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.file.name`                   | `LOG_FILE`                        | If defined, it is used in the default log configuration.     |
| `logging.file.max-size`               | `LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE`               | Maximum log file size (if LOG_FILE enabled). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.file.max-history`            | `LOG_FILE_MAX_HISTORY`            | Maximum number of archive log files to keep (if LOG_FILE enabled). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.file.path`                   | `LOG_PATH`                        | If defined, it is used in the default log configuration.     |
| `logging.file.total-size-cap`         | `LOG_FILE_TOTAL_SIZE_CAP`         | Total size of log backups to be kept (if LOG_FILE enabled). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.pattern.console`             | `CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN`             | The log pattern to use on the console (stdout). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.pattern.dateformat`          | `LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN`          | Appender pattern for log date format. (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.pattern.file`                | `FILE_LOG_PATTERN`                | The log pattern to use in a file (if `LOG_FILE` is enabled). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.pattern.level`               | `LOG_LEVEL_PATTERN`               | The format to use when rendering the log level (default `%5p`). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `logging.pattern.rolling-file-name`   | `ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN`       | Pattern for rolled-over log file names (default `${LOG_FILE}.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.gz`). (Only supported with the default Logback setup.) |
| `PID`                                 | `PID`                             | The current process ID (discovered if possible and when not already defined as an OS environment variable). |

All the supported logging systems can consult System properties when parsing their configuration files. See the default configurations in `spring-boot.jar` for examples:

- [Logback](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/resources/org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml)
- [Log4j 2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/resources/org/springframework/boot/logging/log4j2/log4j2.xml)
- [Java Util logging](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/resources/org/springframework/boot/logging/java/logging-file.properties)

|      | If you want to use a placeholder in a logging property, you should use [Spring Boot’s syntax](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-placeholders-in-properties) and not the syntax of the underlying framework. Notably, if you use Logback, you should use `:` as the delimiter between a property name and its default value and not use `:-`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | You can add MDC and other ad-hoc content to log lines by overriding only the `LOG_LEVEL_PATTERN` (or `logging.pattern.level` with Logback). For example, if you use `logging.pattern.level=user:%X{user} %5p`, then the default log format contains an MDC entry for "user", if it exists, as shown in the following example.`2019-08-30 12:30:04.031 user:someone INFO 22174 --- [  nio-8080-exec-0] demo.Controller Handling authenticated request` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.4.7. Logback Extensions

Spring Boot includes a number of extensions to Logback that can help with advanced configuration. You can use these extensions in your `logback-spring.xml` configuration file.

|      | Because the standard `logback.xml` configuration file is loaded too early, you cannot use extensions in it. You need to either use `logback-spring.xml` or define a `logging.config` property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | The extensions cannot be used with Logback’s [configuration scanning](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#autoScan). If you attempt to do so, making changes to the configuration file results in an error similar to one of the following being logged: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Profile-specific Configuration

The `` tag lets you optionally include or exclude sections of configuration based on the active Spring profiles. Profile sections are supported anywhere within the `` element. Use the `name` attribute to specify which profile accepts the configuration. The `` tag can contain a profile name (for example `staging`) or a profile expression. A profile expression allows for more complicated profile logic to be expressed, for example `production & (eu-central | eu-west)`. Check the [reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition-profiles-java) for more details. The following listing shows three sample profiles:

```xml
<springProfile name="staging">
    <!-- configuration to be enabled when the "staging" profile is active -->
</springProfile>

<springProfile name="dev | staging">
    <!-- configuration to be enabled when the "dev" or "staging" profiles are active -->
</springProfile>

<springProfile name="!production">
    <!-- configuration to be enabled when the "production" profile is not active -->
</springProfile>
```

##### Environment Properties

The `` tag lets you expose properties from the Spring `Environment` for use within Logback. Doing so can be useful if you want to access values from your `application.properties` file in your Logback configuration. The tag works in a similar way to Logback’s standard `` tag. However, rather than specifying a direct `value`, you specify the `source` of the property (from the `Environment`). If you need to store the property somewhere other than in `local` scope, you can use the `scope` attribute. If you need a fallback value (in case the property is not set in the `Environment`), you can use the `defaultValue` attribute. The following example shows how to expose properties for use within Logback:

```xml
<springProperty scope="context" name="fluentHost" source="myapp.fluentd.host"
        defaultValue="localhost"/>
<appender name="FLUENT" class="ch.qos.logback.more.appenders.DataFluentAppender">
    <remoteHost>${fluentHost}</remoteHost>
    ...
</appender>
```

|      | The `source` must be specified in kebab case (such as `my.property-name`). However, properties can be added to the `Environment` by using the relaxed rules. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 4.5. Internationalization

Spring Boot supports localized messages so that your application can cater to users of different language preferences. By default, Spring Boot looks for the presence of a `messages` resource bundle at the root of the classpath.

|      | The auto-configuration applies when the default properties file for the configured resource bundle is available (i.e. `messages.properties` by default). If your resource bundle contains only language-specific properties files, you are required to add the default. If no properties file is found that matches any of the configured base names, there will be no auto-configured `MessageSource`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The basename of the resource bundle as well as several other attributes can be configured using the `spring.messages` namespace, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.messages.basename=messages,config.i18n.messages
spring.messages.fallback-to-system-locale=false
```

|      | `spring.messages.basename` supports comma-separated list of locations, either a package qualifier or a resource resolved from the classpath root. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

See [`MessageSourceProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/context/MessageSourceProperties.java) for more supported options.

### 4.6. JSON

Spring Boot provides integration with three JSON mapping libraries:

- Gson
- Jackson
- JSON-B

Jackson is the preferred and default library.

#### 4.6.1. Jackson

Auto-configuration for Jackson is provided and Jackson is part of `spring-boot-starter-json`. When Jackson is on the classpath an `ObjectMapper` bean is automatically configured. Several configuration properties are provided for [customizing the configuration of the `ObjectMapper`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-customize-the-jackson-objectmapper).

#### 4.6.2. Gson

Auto-configuration for Gson is provided. When Gson is on the classpath a `Gson` bean is automatically configured. Several `spring.gson.*` configuration properties are provided for customizing the configuration. To take more control, one or more `GsonBuilderCustomizer` beans can be used.

#### 4.6.3. JSON-B

Auto-configuration for JSON-B is provided. When the JSON-B API and an implementation are on the classpath a `Jsonb` bean will be automatically configured. The preferred JSON-B implementation is Apache Johnzon for which dependency management is provided.

### 4.7. Developing Web Applications

Spring Boot is well suited for web application development. You can create a self-contained HTTP server by using embedded Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, or Netty. Most web applications use the `spring-boot-starter-web` module to get up and running quickly. You can also choose to build reactive web applications by using the `spring-boot-starter-webflux` module.

If you have not yet developed a Spring Boot web application, you can follow the "Hello World!" example in the *[Getting started](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application)* section.

#### 4.7.1. The “Spring Web MVC Framework”

The [Spring Web MVC framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc) (often referred to as “Spring MVC”) is a rich “model view controller” web framework. Spring MVC lets you create special `@Controller` or `@RestController` beans to handle incoming HTTP requests. Methods in your controller are mapped to HTTP by using `@RequestMapping` annotations.

The following code shows a typical `@RestController` that serves JSON data:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(value="/users")
public class MyRestController {

    @RequestMapping(value="/{user}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long user) {
        // ...
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/{user}/customers", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    List<Customer> getUserCustomers(@PathVariable Long user) {
        // ...
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/{user}", method=RequestMethod.DELETE)
    public User deleteUser(@PathVariable Long user) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

Spring MVC is part of the core Spring Framework, and detailed information is available in the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc). There are also several guides that cover Spring MVC available at [spring.io/guides](https://spring.io/guides).

##### Spring MVC Auto-configuration

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring MVC that works well with most applications.

The auto-configuration adds the following features on top of Spring’s defaults:

- Inclusion of `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver` and `BeanNameViewResolver` beans.
- Support for serving static resources, including support for WebJars (covered [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-static-content))).
- Automatic registration of `Converter`, `GenericConverter`, and `Formatter` beans.
- Support for `HttpMessageConverters` (covered [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-message-converters)).
- Automatic registration of `MessageCodesResolver` (covered [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-message-codes)).
- Static `index.html` support.
- Custom `Favicon` support (covered [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-favicon)).
- Automatic use of a `ConfigurableWebBindingInitializer` bean (covered [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-web-binding-initializer)).

If you want to keep those Spring Boot MVC customizations and make more [MVC customizations](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc) (interceptors, formatters, view controllers, and other features), you can add your own `@Configuration` class of type `WebMvcConfigurer` but **without** `@EnableWebMvc`.

If you want to provide custom instances of `RequestMappingHandlerMapping`, `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter`, or `ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver`, and still keep the Spring Boot MVC customizations, you can declare a bean of type `WebMvcRegistrations` and use it to provide custom instances of those components.

If you want to take complete control of Spring MVC, you can add your own `@Configuration` annotated with `@EnableWebMvc`, or alternatively add your own `@Configuration`-annotated `DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration` as described in the Javadoc of `@EnableWebMvc`.

##### HttpMessageConverters

Spring MVC uses the `HttpMessageConverter` interface to convert HTTP requests and responses. Sensible defaults are included out of the box. For example, objects can be automatically converted to JSON (by using the Jackson library) or XML (by using the Jackson XML extension, if available, or by using JAXB if the Jackson XML extension is not available). By default, strings are encoded in `UTF-8`.

If you need to add or customize converters, you can use Spring Boot’s `HttpMessageConverters` class, as shown in the following listing:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.http.HttpMessageConverters;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.http.converter.*;

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public HttpMessageConverters customConverters() {
        HttpMessageConverter<?> additional = ...
        HttpMessageConverter<?> another = ...
        return new HttpMessageConverters(additional, another);
    }

}
```

Any `HttpMessageConverter` bean that is present in the context is added to the list of converters. You can also override default converters in the same way.

##### Custom JSON Serializers and Deserializers

If you use Jackson to serialize and deserialize JSON data, you might want to write your own `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` classes. Custom serializers are usually [registered with Jackson through a module](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonHowToCustomSerializers), but Spring Boot provides an alternative `@JsonComponent` annotation that makes it easier to directly register Spring Beans.

You can use the `@JsonComponent` annotation directly on `JsonSerializer`, `JsonDeserializer` or `KeyDeserializer` implementations. You can also use it on classes that contain serializers/deserializers as inner classes, as shown in the following example:

```java
import java.io.*;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.*;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.*;
import org.springframework.boot.jackson.*;

@JsonComponent
public class Example {

    public static class Serializer extends JsonSerializer<SomeObject> {
        // ...
    }

    public static class Deserializer extends JsonDeserializer<SomeObject> {
        // ...
    }

}
```

All `@JsonComponent` beans in the `ApplicationContext` are automatically registered with Jackson. Because `@JsonComponent` is meta-annotated with `@Component`, the usual component-scanning rules apply.

Spring Boot also provides [`JsonObjectSerializer`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jackson/JsonObjectSerializer.java) and [`JsonObjectDeserializer`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jackson/JsonObjectDeserializer.java) base classes that provide useful alternatives to the standard Jackson versions when serializing objects. See [`JsonObjectSerializer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/jackson/JsonObjectSerializer.html) and [`JsonObjectDeserializer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/jackson/JsonObjectDeserializer.html) in the Javadoc for details.

##### MessageCodesResolver

Spring MVC has a strategy for generating error codes for rendering error messages from binding errors: `MessageCodesResolver`. If you set the `spring.mvc.message-codes-resolver-format` property `PREFIX_ERROR_CODE` or `POSTFIX_ERROR_CODE`, Spring Boot creates one for you (see the enumeration in [`DefaultMessageCodesResolver.Format`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.Format.html)).

##### Static Content

By default, Spring Boot serves static content from a directory called `/static` (or `/public` or `/resources` or `/META-INF/resources`) in the classpath or from the root of the `ServletContext`. It uses the `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` from Spring MVC so that you can modify that behavior by adding your own `WebMvcConfigurer` and overriding the `addResourceHandlers` method.

In a stand-alone web application, the default servlet from the container is also enabled and acts as a fallback, serving content from the root of the `ServletContext` if Spring decides not to handle it. Most of the time, this does not happen (unless you modify the default MVC configuration), because Spring can always handle requests through the `DispatcherServlet`.

By default, resources are mapped on `/**`, but you can tune that with the `spring.mvc.static-path-pattern` property. For instance, relocating all resources to `/resources/**` can be achieved as follows:

```properties
spring.mvc.static-path-pattern=/resources/**
```

You can also customize the static resource locations by using the `spring.resources.static-locations` property (replacing the default values with a list of directory locations). The root Servlet context path, `"/"`, is automatically added as a location as well.

In addition to the “standard” static resource locations mentioned earlier, a special case is made for [Webjars content](https://www.webjars.org/). Any resources with a path in `/webjars/**` are served from jar files if they are packaged in the Webjars format.

|      | Do not use the `src/main/webapp` directory if your application is packaged as a jar. Although this directory is a common standard, it works **only** with war packaging, and it is silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot also supports the advanced resource handling features provided by Spring MVC, allowing use cases such as cache-busting static resources or using version agnostic URLs for Webjars.

To use version agnostic URLs for Webjars, add the `webjars-locator-core` dependency. Then declare your Webjar. Using jQuery as an example, adding `"/webjars/jquery/jquery.min.js"` results in `"/webjars/jquery/x.y.z/jquery.min.js"` where `x.y.z` is the Webjar version.

|      | If you use JBoss, you need to declare the `webjars-locator-jboss-vfs` dependency instead of the `webjars-locator-core`. Otherwise, all Webjars resolve as a `404`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To use cache busting, the following configuration configures a cache busting solution for all static resources, effectively adding a content hash, such as ``, in URLs:

```properties
spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.enabled=true
spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.paths=/**
```

|      | Links to resources are rewritten in templates at runtime, thanks to a `ResourceUrlEncodingFilter` that is auto-configured for Thymeleaf and FreeMarker. You should manually declare this filter when using JSPs. Other template engines are currently not automatically supported but can be with custom template macros/helpers and the use of the [`ResourceUrlProvider`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/ResourceUrlProvider.html). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

When loading resources dynamically with, for example, a JavaScript module loader, renaming files is not an option. That is why other strategies are also supported and can be combined. A "fixed" strategy adds a static version string in the URL without changing the file name, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.enabled=true
spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.paths=/**
spring.resources.chain.strategy.fixed.enabled=true
spring.resources.chain.strategy.fixed.paths=/js/lib/
spring.resources.chain.strategy.fixed.version=v12
```

With this configuration, JavaScript modules located under `"/js/lib/"` use a fixed versioning strategy (`"/v12/js/lib/mymodule.js"`), while other resources still use the content one (``).

See [`ResourceProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/ResourceProperties.java) for more supported options.

|      | This feature has been thoroughly described in a dedicated [blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/24/spring-framework-4-1-handling-static-web-resources) and in Spring Framework’s [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-config-static-resources). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Welcome Page

Spring Boot supports both static and templated welcome pages. It first looks for an `index.html` file in the configured static content locations. If one is not found, it then looks for an `index` template. If either is found, it is automatically used as the welcome page of the application.

##### Custom Favicon

As with other static resources, Spring Boot looks for a `favicon.ico` in the configured static content locations. If such a file is present, it is automatically used as the favicon of the application.

##### Path Matching and Content Negotiation

Spring MVC can map incoming HTTP requests to handlers by looking at the request path and matching it to the mappings defined in your application (for example, `@GetMapping` annotations on Controller methods).

Spring Boot chooses to disable suffix pattern matching by default, which means that requests like `"GET /projects/spring-boot.json"` won’t be matched to `@GetMapping("/projects/spring-boot")` mappings. This is considered as a [best practice for Spring MVC applications](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping-suffix-pattern-match). This feature was mainly useful in the past for HTTP clients which did not send proper "Accept" request headers; we needed to make sure to send the correct Content Type to the client. Nowadays, Content Negotiation is much more reliable.

There are other ways to deal with HTTP clients that don’t consistently send proper "Accept" request headers. Instead of using suffix matching, we can use a query parameter to ensure that requests like `"GET /projects/spring-boot?format=json"` will be mapped to `@GetMapping("/projects/spring-boot")`:

```properties
spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.favor-parameter=true

# We can change the parameter name, which is "format" by default:
# spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.parameter-name=myparam

# We can also register additional file extensions/media types with:
spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.media-types.markdown=text/markdown
```

Suffix pattern matching is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you understand the caveats and would still like your application to use suffix pattern matching, the following configuration is required:

```properties
spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.favor-path-extension=true
spring.mvc.pathmatch.use-suffix-pattern=true
```

Alternatively, rather than open all suffix patterns, it’s more secure to only support registered suffix patterns:

```properties
spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.favor-path-extension=true
spring.mvc.pathmatch.use-registered-suffix-pattern=true

# You can also register additional file extensions/media types with:
# spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.media-types.adoc=text/asciidoc
```

##### ConfigurableWebBindingInitializer

Spring MVC uses a `WebBindingInitializer` to initialize a `WebDataBinder` for a particular request. If you create your own `ConfigurableWebBindingInitializer` `@Bean`, Spring Boot automatically configures Spring MVC to use it.

##### Template Engines

As well as REST web services, you can also use Spring MVC to serve dynamic HTML content. Spring MVC supports a variety of templating technologies, including Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and JSPs. Also, many other templating engines include their own Spring MVC integrations.

Spring Boot includes auto-configuration support for the following templating engines:

- [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/)
- [Groovy](https://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/documentation/template-engines.html#_the_markuptemplateengine)
- [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/)

|      | If possible, JSPs should be avoided. There are several [known limitations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-jsp-limitations) when using them with embedded servlet containers. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

When you use one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your templates are picked up automatically from `src/main/resources/templates`.

|      | Depending on how you run your application, IntelliJ IDEA orders the classpath differently. Running your application in the IDE from its main method results in a different ordering than when you run your application by using Maven or Gradle or from its packaged jar. This can cause Spring Boot to fail to find the templates on the classpath. If you have this problem, you can reorder the classpath in the IDE to place the module’s classes and resources first. Alternatively, you can configure the template prefix to search every `templates` directory on the classpath, as follows: `classpath*:/templates/`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Error Handling

By default, Spring Boot provides an `/error` mapping that handles all errors in a sensible way, and it is registered as a “global” error page in the servlet container. For machine clients, it produces a JSON response with details of the error, the HTTP status, and the exception message. For browser clients, there is a “whitelabel” error view that renders the same data in HTML format (to customize it, add a `View` that resolves to `error`). To replace the default behavior completely, you can implement `ErrorController` and register a bean definition of that type or add a bean of type `ErrorAttributes` to use the existing mechanism but replace the contents.

|      | The `BasicErrorController` can be used as a base class for a custom `ErrorController`. This is particularly useful if you want to add a handler for a new content type (the default is to handle `text/html` specifically and provide a fallback for everything else). To do so, extend `BasicErrorController`, add a public method with a `@RequestMapping` that has a `produces` attribute, and create a bean of your new type. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can also define a class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice` to customize the JSON document to return for a particular controller and/or exception type, as shown in the following example:

```java
@ControllerAdvice(basePackageClasses = AcmeController.class)
public class AcmeControllerAdvice extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(YourException.class)
    @ResponseBody
    ResponseEntity<?> handleControllerException(HttpServletRequest request, Throwable ex) {
        HttpStatus status = getStatus(request);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(new CustomErrorType(status.value(), ex.getMessage()), status);
    }

    private HttpStatus getStatus(HttpServletRequest request) {
        Integer statusCode = (Integer) request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.error.status_code");
        if (statusCode == null) {
            return HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR;
        }
        return HttpStatus.valueOf(statusCode);
    }

}
```

In the preceding example, if `YourException` is thrown by a controller defined in the same package as `AcmeController`, a JSON representation of the `CustomErrorType` POJO is used instead of the `ErrorAttributes` representation.

###### Custom Error Pages

If you want to display a custom HTML error page for a given status code, you can add a file to an `/error` folder. Error pages can either be static HTML (that is, added under any of the static resource folders) or be built by using templates. The name of the file should be the exact status code or a series mask.

For example, to map `404` to a static HTML file, your folder structure would be as follows:

```
src/
 +- main/
     +- java/
     |   + <source code>
     +- resources/
         +- public/
             +- error/
             |   +- 404.html
             +- <other public assets>
```

To map all `5xx` errors by using a FreeMarker template, your folder structure would be as follows:

```
src/
 +- main/
     +- java/
     |   + <source code>
     +- resources/
         +- templates/
             +- error/
             |   +- 5xx.ftlh
             +- <other templates>
```

For more complex mappings, you can also add beans that implement the `ErrorViewResolver` interface, as shown in the following example:

```java
public class MyErrorViewResolver implements ErrorViewResolver {

    @Override
    public ModelAndView resolveErrorView(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpStatus status, Map<String, Object> model) {
        // Use the request or status to optionally return a ModelAndView
        return ...
    }

}
```

You can also use regular Spring MVC features such as [`@ExceptionHandler` methods](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-exceptionhandlers) and [`@ControllerAdvice`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-controller-advice). The `ErrorController` then picks up any unhandled exceptions.

###### Mapping Error Pages outside of Spring MVC

For applications that do not use Spring MVC, you can use the `ErrorPageRegistrar` interface to directly register `ErrorPages`. This abstraction works directly with the underlying embedded servlet container and works even if you do not have a Spring MVC `DispatcherServlet`.

```java
@Bean
public ErrorPageRegistrar errorPageRegistrar(){
    return new MyErrorPageRegistrar();
}

// ...

private static class MyErrorPageRegistrar implements ErrorPageRegistrar {

    @Override
    public void registerErrorPages(ErrorPageRegistry registry) {
        registry.addErrorPages(new ErrorPage(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, "/400"));
    }

}
```

|      | If you register an `ErrorPage` with a path that ends up being handled by a `Filter` (as is common with some non-Spring web frameworks, like Jersey and Wicket), then the `Filter` has to be explicitly registered as an `ERROR` dispatcher, as shown in the following example: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

```java
@Bean
public FilterRegistrationBean myFilter() {
    FilterRegistrationBean registration = new FilterRegistrationBean();
    registration.setFilter(new MyFilter());
    ...
    registration.setDispatcherTypes(EnumSet.allOf(DispatcherType.class));
    return registration;
}
```

Note that the default `FilterRegistrationBean` does not include the `ERROR` dispatcher type.

###### Error handling in a war deployment

When deployed to a servlet container, Spring Boot uses its error page filter to forward a request with an error status to the appropriate error page. This is necessary as the Servlet specification does not provide an API for registering error pages. Depending on the container that you are deploying your war file to and the technologies that your application uses, some additional configuration may be required.

The error page filter can only forward the request to the correct error page if the response has not already been committed. By default, WebSphere Application Server 8.0 and later commits the response upon successful completion of a servlet’s service method. You should disable this behavior by setting `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokeFlushAfterService` to `false`.

If you are using Spring Security and want to access the principal in an error page, you must configure Spring Security’s filter to be invoked on error dispatches. To do so, set the `spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types` property to `async, error, forward, request`.

##### Spring HATEOAS

If you develop a RESTful API that makes use of hypermedia, Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring HATEOAS that works well with most applications. The auto-configuration replaces the need to use `@EnableHypermediaSupport` and registers a number of beans to ease building hypermedia-based applications, including a `LinkDiscoverers` (for client side support) and an `ObjectMapper` configured to correctly marshal responses into the desired representation. The `ObjectMapper` is customized by setting the various `spring.jackson.*` properties or, if one exists, by a `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` bean.

You can take control of Spring HATEOAS’s configuration by using `@EnableHypermediaSupport`. Note that doing so disables the `ObjectMapper` customization described earlier.

##### CORS Support

[Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS) is a [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) implemented by [most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=cors) that lets you specify in a flexible way what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized., instead of using some less secure and less powerful approaches such as IFRAME or JSONP.

As of version 4.2, Spring MVC [supports CORS](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-cors). Using [controller method CORS configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-cors-controller) with [`@CrossOrigin`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/CrossOrigin.html) annotations in your Spring Boot application does not require any specific configuration. [Global CORS configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-cors-global) can be defined by registering a `WebMvcConfigurer` bean with a customized `addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry)` method, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping("/api/**");
            }
        };
    }
}
```

#### 4.7.2. The “Spring WebFlux Framework”

Spring WebFlux is the new reactive web framework introduced in Spring Framework 5.0. Unlike Spring MVC, it does not require the Servlet API, is fully asynchronous and non-blocking, and implements the [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) specification through [the Reactor project](https://projectreactor.io/).

Spring WebFlux comes in two flavors: functional and annotation-based. The annotation-based one is quite close to the Spring MVC model, as shown in the following example:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping("/{user}")
    public Mono<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long user) {
        // ...
    }

    @GetMapping("/{user}/customers")
    public Flux<Customer> getUserCustomers(@PathVariable Long user) {
        // ...
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{user}")
    public Mono<User> deleteUser(@PathVariable Long user) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

“WebFlux.fn”, the functional variant, separates the routing configuration from the actual handling of the requests, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class RoutingConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> monoRouterFunction(UserHandler userHandler) {
        return route(GET("/{user}").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), userHandler::getUser)
                .andRoute(GET("/{user}/customers").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), userHandler::getUserCustomers)
                .andRoute(DELETE("/{user}").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), userHandler::deleteUser);
    }

}

@Component
public class UserHandler {

    public Mono<ServerResponse> getUser(ServerRequest request) {
        // ...
    }

    public Mono<ServerResponse> getUserCustomers(ServerRequest request) {
        // ...
    }

    public Mono<ServerResponse> deleteUser(ServerRequest request) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

WebFlux is part of the Spring Framework and detailed information is available in its [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-fn).

|      | You can define as many `RouterFunction` beans as you like to modularize the definition of the router. Beans can be ordered if you need to apply a precedence. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To get started, add the `spring-boot-starter-webflux` module to your application.

|      | Adding both `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-webflux` modules in your application results in Spring Boot auto-configuring Spring MVC, not WebFlux. This behavior has been chosen because many Spring developers add `spring-boot-starter-webflux` to their Spring MVC application to use the reactive `WebClient`. You can still enforce your choice by setting the chosen application type to `SpringApplication.setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.REACTIVE)`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Spring WebFlux Auto-configuration

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring WebFlux that works well with most applications.

The auto-configuration adds the following features on top of Spring’s defaults:

- Configuring codecs for `HttpMessageReader` and `HttpMessageWriter` instances (described [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-webflux-httpcodecs)).
- Support for serving static resources, including support for WebJars (described [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-static-content)).

If you want to keep Spring Boot WebFlux features and you want to add additional [WebFlux configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-config), you can add your own `@Configuration` class of type `WebFluxConfigurer` but **without** `@EnableWebFlux`.

If you want to take complete control of Spring WebFlux, you can add your own `@Configuration` annotated with `@EnableWebFlux`.

##### HTTP Codecs with HttpMessageReaders and HttpMessageWriters

Spring WebFlux uses the `HttpMessageReader` and `HttpMessageWriter` interfaces to convert HTTP requests and responses. They are configured with `CodecConfigurer` to have sensible defaults by looking at the libraries available in your classpath.

Spring Boot provides dedicated configuration properties for codecs, `spring.codec.*`. It also applies further customization by using `CodecCustomizer` instances. For example, `spring.jackson.*` configuration keys are applied to the Jackson codec.

If you need to add or customize codecs, you can create a custom `CodecCustomizer` component, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.web.codec.CodecCustomizer;

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CodecCustomizer myCodecCustomizer() {
        return codecConfigurer -> {
            // ...
        };
    }

}
```

You can also leverage [Boot’s custom JSON serializers and deserializers](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-json-components).

##### Static Content

By default, Spring Boot serves static content from a directory called `/static` (or `/public` or `/resources` or `/META-INF/resources`) in the classpath. It uses the `ResourceWebHandler` from Spring WebFlux so that you can modify that behavior by adding your own `WebFluxConfigurer` and overriding the `addResourceHandlers` method.

By default, resources are mapped on `/**`, but you can tune that by setting the `spring.webflux.static-path-pattern` property. For instance, relocating all resources to `/resources/**` can be achieved as follows:

```properties
spring.webflux.static-path-pattern=/resources/**
```

You can also customize the static resource locations by using `spring.resources.static-locations`. Doing so replaces the default values with a list of directory locations. If you do so, the default welcome page detection switches to your custom locations. So, if there is an `index.html` in any of your locations on startup, it is the home page of the application.

In addition to the “standard” static resource locations listed earlier, a special case is made for [Webjars content](https://www.webjars.org/). Any resources with a path in `/webjars/**` are served from jar files if they are packaged in the Webjars format.

|      | Spring WebFlux applications do not strictly depend on the Servlet API, so they cannot be deployed as war files and do not use the `src/main/webapp` directory. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Template Engines

As well as REST web services, you can also use Spring WebFlux to serve dynamic HTML content. Spring WebFlux supports a variety of templating technologies, including Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and Mustache.

Spring Boot includes auto-configuration support for the following templating engines:

- [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/)
- [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/)

When you use one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your templates are picked up automatically from `src/main/resources/templates`.

##### Error Handling

Spring Boot provides a `WebExceptionHandler` that handles all errors in a sensible way. Its position in the processing order is immediately before the handlers provided by WebFlux, which are considered last. For machine clients, it produces a JSON response with details of the error, the HTTP status, and the exception message. For browser clients, there is a “whitelabel” error handler that renders the same data in HTML format. You can also provide your own HTML templates to display errors (see the [next section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-webflux-error-handling-custom-error-pages)).

The first step to customizing this feature often involves using the existing mechanism but replacing or augmenting the error contents. For that, you can add a bean of type `ErrorAttributes`.

To change the error handling behavior, you can implement `ErrorWebExceptionHandler` and register a bean definition of that type. Because a `WebExceptionHandler` is quite low-level, Spring Boot also provides a convenient `AbstractErrorWebExceptionHandler` to let you handle errors in a WebFlux functional way, as shown in the following example:

```java
public class CustomErrorWebExceptionHandler extends AbstractErrorWebExceptionHandler {

    // Define constructor here

    @Override
    protected RouterFunction<ServerResponse> getRoutingFunction(ErrorAttributes errorAttributes) {

        return RouterFunctions
                .route(aPredicate, aHandler)
                .andRoute(anotherPredicate, anotherHandler);
    }

}
```

For a more complete picture, you can also subclass `DefaultErrorWebExceptionHandler` directly and override specific methods.

###### Custom Error Pages

If you want to display a custom HTML error page for a given status code, you can add a file to an `/error` folder. Error pages can either be static HTML (that is, added under any of the static resource folders) or built with templates. The name of the file should be the exact status code or a series mask.

For example, to map `404` to a static HTML file, your folder structure would be as follows:

```
src/
 +- main/
     +- java/
     |   + <source code>
     +- resources/
         +- public/
             +- error/
             |   +- 404.html
             +- <other public assets>
```

To map all `5xx` errors by using a Mustache template, your folder structure would be as follows:

```
src/
 +- main/
     +- java/
     |   + <source code>
     +- resources/
         +- templates/
             +- error/
             |   +- 5xx.mustache
             +- <other templates>
```

##### Web Filters

Spring WebFlux provides a `WebFilter` interface that can be implemented to filter HTTP request-response exchanges. `WebFilter` beans found in the application context will be automatically used to filter each exchange.

Where the order of the filters is important they can implement `Ordered` or be annotated with `@Order`. Spring Boot auto-configuration may configure web filters for you. When it does so, the orders shown in the following table will be used:

| Web Filter                              | Order                            |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| `MetricsWebFilter`                      | `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 1` |
| `WebFilterChainProxy` (Spring Security) | `-100`                           |
| `HttpTraceWebFilter`                    | `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE - 10` |

#### 4.7.3. JAX-RS and Jersey

If you prefer the JAX-RS programming model for REST endpoints, you can use one of the available implementations instead of Spring MVC. [Jersey](https://jersey.github.io/) and [Apache CXF](https://cxf.apache.org/) work quite well out of the box. CXF requires you to register its `Servlet` or `Filter` as a `@Bean` in your application context. Jersey has some native Spring support, so we also provide auto-configuration support for it in Spring Boot, together with a starter.

To get started with Jersey, include the `spring-boot-starter-jersey` as a dependency and then you need one `@Bean` of type `ResourceConfig` in which you register all the endpoints, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class JerseyConfig extends ResourceConfig {

    public JerseyConfig() {
        register(Endpoint.class);
    }

}
```

|      | Jersey’s support for scanning executable archives is rather limited. For example, it cannot scan for endpoints in a package found in a [fully executable jar file](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-install) or in `WEB-INF/classes` when running an executable war file. To avoid this limitation, the `packages` method should not be used, and endpoints should be registered individually by using the `register` method, as shown in the preceding example. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

For more advanced customizations, you can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `ResourceConfigCustomizer`.

All the registered endpoints should be `@Components` with HTTP resource annotations (`@GET` and others), as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
@Path("/hello")
public class Endpoint {

    @GET
    public String message() {
        return "Hello";
    }

}
```

Since the `Endpoint` is a Spring `@Component`, its lifecycle is managed by Spring and you can use the `@Autowired` annotation to inject dependencies and use the `@Value` annotation to inject external configuration. By default, the Jersey servlet is registered and mapped to `/*`. You can change the mapping by adding `@ApplicationPath` to your `ResourceConfig`.

By default, Jersey is set up as a Servlet in a `@Bean` of type `ServletRegistrationBean` named `jerseyServletRegistration`. By default, the servlet is initialized lazily, but you can customize that behavior by setting `spring.jersey.servlet.load-on-startup`. You can disable or override that bean by creating one of your own with the same name. You can also use a filter instead of a servlet by setting `spring.jersey.type=filter` (in which case, the `@Bean` to replace or override is `jerseyFilterRegistration`). The filter has an `@Order`, which you can set with `spring.jersey.filter.order`. Both the servlet and the filter registrations can be given init parameters by using `spring.jersey.init.*` to specify a map of properties.

#### 4.7.4. Embedded Servlet Container Support

Spring Boot includes support for embedded [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/), and [Undertow](https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow) servers. Most developers use the appropriate “Starter” to obtain a fully configured instance. By default, the embedded server listens for HTTP requests on port `8080`.

##### Servlets, Filters, and listeners

When using an embedded servlet container, you can register servlets, filters, and all the listeners (such as `HttpSessionListener`) from the Servlet spec, either by using Spring beans or by scanning for Servlet components.

###### Registering Servlets, Filters, and Listeners as Spring Beans

Any `Servlet`, `Filter`, or servlet `*Listener` instance that is a Spring bean is registered with the embedded container. This can be particularly convenient if you want to refer to a value from your `application.properties` during configuration.

By default, if the context contains only a single Servlet, it is mapped to `/`. In the case of multiple servlet beans, the bean name is used as a path prefix. Filters map to `/*`.

If convention-based mapping is not flexible enough, you can use the `ServletRegistrationBean`, `FilterRegistrationBean`, and `ServletListenerRegistrationBean` classes for complete control.

It is usually safe to leave Filter beans unordered. If a specific order is required, you should annotate the `Filter` with `@Order` or make it implement `Ordered`. You cannot configure the order of a `Filter` by annotating its bean method with `@Order`. If you cannot change the `Filter` class to add `@Order` or implement `Ordered`, you must define a `FilterRegistrationBean` for the `Filter` and set the registration bean’s order using the `setOrder(int)` method. Avoid configuring a Filter that reads the request body at `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE`, since it might go against the character encoding configuration of your application. If a Servlet filter wraps the request, it should be configured with an order that is less than or equal to `OrderedFilter.REQUEST_WRAPPER_FILTER_MAX_ORDER`.

|      | To see the order of every `Filter` in your application, enable debug level logging for the `web` [logging group](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-log-groups) (`logging.level.web=debug`). Details of the registered filters, including their order and URL patterns, will then be logged at startup. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Take care when registering `Filter` beans since they are initialized very early in the application lifectyle. If you need to register a `Filter` that interacts with other beans, consider using a [`DelegatingFilterProxyRegistrationBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/web/servlet/DelegatingFilterProxyRegistrationBean.html) instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Servlet Context Initialization

Embedded servlet containers do not directly execute the Servlet 3.0+ `javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` interface or Spring’s `org.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializer` interface. This is an intentional design decision intended to reduce the risk that third party libraries designed to run inside a war may break Spring Boot applications.

If you need to perform servlet context initialization in a Spring Boot application, you should register a bean that implements the `org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.ServletContextInitializer` interface. The single `onStartup` method provides access to the `ServletContext` and, if necessary, can easily be used as an adapter to an existing `WebApplicationInitializer`.

###### Scanning for Servlets, Filters, and listeners

When using an embedded container, automatic registration of classes annotated with `@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter`, and `@WebListener` can be enabled by using `@ServletComponentScan`.

|      | `@ServletComponentScan` has no effect in a standalone container, where the container’s built-in discovery mechanisms are used instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### The ServletWebServerApplicationContext

Under the hood, Spring Boot uses a different type of `ApplicationContext` for embedded servlet container support. The `ServletWebServerApplicationContext` is a special type of `WebApplicationContext` that bootstraps itself by searching for a single `ServletWebServerFactory` bean. Usually a `TomcatServletWebServerFactory`, `JettyServletWebServerFactory`, or `UndertowServletWebServerFactory` has been auto-configured.

|      | You usually do not need to be aware of these implementation classes. Most applications are auto-configured, and the appropriate `ApplicationContext` and `ServletWebServerFactory` are created on your behalf. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Customizing Embedded Servlet Containers

Common servlet container settings can be configured by using Spring `Environment` properties. Usually, you would define the properties in your `application.properties` file.

Common server settings include:

- Network settings: Listen port for incoming HTTP requests (`server.port`), interface address to bind to `server.address`, and so on.
- Session settings: Whether the session is persistent (`server.servlet.session.persistent`), session timeout (`server.servlet.session.timeout`), location of session data (`server.servlet.session.store-dir`), and session-cookie configuration (`server.servlet.session.cookie.*`).
- Error management: Location of the error page (`server.error.path`) and so on.
- [SSL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-ssl)
- [HTTP compression](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#how-to-enable-http-response-compression)

Spring Boot tries as much as possible to expose common settings, but this is not always possible. For those cases, dedicated namespaces offer server-specific customizations (see `server.tomcat` and `server.undertow`). For instance, [access logs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-accesslogs) can be configured with specific features of the embedded servlet container.

|      | See the [`ServerProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/ServerProperties.java) class for a complete list. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Programmatic Customization

If you need to programmatically configure your embedded servlet container, you can register a Spring bean that implements the `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` interface. `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` provides access to the `ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory`, which includes numerous customization setter methods. The following example shows programmatically setting the port:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.web.server.WebServerFactoryCustomizer;
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.server.ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CustomizationBean implements WebServerFactoryCustomizer<ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory> {

    @Override
    public void customize(ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory server) {
        server.setPort(9000);
    }

}
```

|      | `TomcatServletWebServerFactory`, `JettyServletWebServerFactory` and `UndertowServletWebServerFactory` are dedicated variants of `ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory` that have additional customization setter methods for Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow respectively. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Customizing ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory Directly

If the preceding customization techniques are too limited, you can register the `TomcatServletWebServerFactory`, `JettyServletWebServerFactory`, or `UndertowServletWebServerFactory` bean yourself.

```java
@Bean
public ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory webServerFactory() {
    TomcatServletWebServerFactory factory = new TomcatServletWebServerFactory();
    factory.setPort(9000);
    factory.setSessionTimeout(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    factory.addErrorPages(new ErrorPage(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "/notfound.html"));
    return factory;
}
```

Setters are provided for many configuration options. Several protected method “hooks” are also provided should you need to do something more exotic. See the [source code documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/web/servlet/server/ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory.html) for details.

##### JSP Limitations

When running a Spring Boot application that uses an embedded servlet container (and is packaged as an executable archive), there are some limitations in the JSP support.

- With Jetty and Tomcat, it should work if you use war packaging. An executable war will work when launched with `java -jar`, and will also be deployable to any standard container. JSPs are not supported when using an executable jar.
- Undertow does not support JSPs.
- Creating a custom `error.jsp` page does not override the default view for [error handling](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-error-handling). [Custom error pages](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-error-handling-custom-error-pages) should be used instead.

#### 4.7.5. Embedded Reactive Server Support

Spring Boot includes support for the following embedded reactive web servers: Reactor Netty, Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. Most developers use the appropriate “Starter” to obtain a fully configured instance. By default, the embedded server listens for HTTP requests on port 8080.

#### 4.7.6. Reactive Server Resources Configuration

When auto-configuring a Reactor Netty or Jetty server, Spring Boot will create specific beans that will provide HTTP resources to the server instance: `ReactorResourceFactory` or `JettyResourceFactory`.

By default, those resources will be also shared with the Reactor Netty and Jetty clients for optimal performances, given:

- the same technology is used for server and client
- the client instance is built using the `WebClient.Builder` bean auto-configured by Spring Boot

Developers can override the resource configuration for Jetty and Reactor Netty by providing a custom `ReactorResourceFactory` or `JettyResourceFactory` bean - this will be applied to both clients and servers.

You can learn more about the resource configuration on the client side in the [WebClient Runtime section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-webclient-runtime).

### 4.8. RSocket

[RSocket](https://rsocket.io/) is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports. It enables symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection.

The `spring-messaging` module of the Spring Framework provides support for RSocket requesters and responders, both on the client and on the server side. See the [RSocket section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#rsocket-spring) of the Spring Framework reference for more details, including an overview of the RSocket protocol.

#### 4.8.1. RSocket Strategies Auto-configuration

Spring Boot auto-configures an `RSocketStrategies` bean that provides all the required infrastructure for encoding and decoding RSocket payloads. By default, the auto-configuration will try to configure the following (in order):

1. [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) codecs with Jackson
2. JSON codecs with Jackson

The `spring-boot-starter-rsocket` starter provides both dependencies. Check out the [Jackson support section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-json-jackson) to know more about customization possibilities.

Developers can customize the `RSocketStrategies` component by creating beans that implement the `RSocketStrategiesCustomizer` interface. Note that their `@Order` is important, as it determines the order of codecs.

#### 4.8.2. RSocket server Auto-configuration

Spring Boot provides RSocket server auto-configuration. The required dependencies are provided by the `spring-boot-starter-rsocket`.

Spring Boot allows exposing RSocket over WebSocket from a WebFlux server, or standing up an independent RSocket server. This depends on the type of application and its configuration.

For WebFlux application (i.e. of type `WebApplicationType.REACTIVE`), the RSocket server will be plugged into the Web Server only if the following properties match:

```properties
spring.rsocket.server.mapping-path=/rsocket # a mapping path is defined
spring.rsocket.server.transport=websocket # websocket is chosen as a transport
#spring.rsocket.server.port= # no port is defined
```

|      | Plugging RSocket into a web server is only supported with Reactor Netty, as RSocket itself is built with that library. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Alternatively, an RSocket TCP or websocket server is started as an independent, embedded server. Besides the dependency requirements, the only required configuration is to define a port for that server:

```properties
spring.rsocket.server.port=9898 # the only required configuration
spring.rsocket.server.transport=tcp # you're free to configure other properties
```

#### 4.8.3. Spring Messaging RSocket support

Spring Boot will auto-configure the Spring Messaging infrastructure for RSocket.

This means that Spring Boot will create a `RSocketMessageHandler` bean that will handle RSocket requests to your application.

#### 4.8.4. Calling RSocket Services with `RSocketRequester`

Once the `RSocket` channel is established between server and client, any party can send or receive requests to the other.

As a server, you can get injected with an `RSocketRequester` instance on any handler method of an RSocket `@Controller`. As a client, you need to configure and establish an RSocket connection first. Spring Boot auto-configures an `RSocketRequester.Builder` for such cases with the expected codecs.

The `RSocketRequester.Builder` instance is a prototype bean, meaning each injection point will provide you with a new instance . This is done on purpose since this builder is stateful and you shouldn’t create requesters with different setups using the same instance.

The following code shows a typical example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final Mono<RSocketRequester> rsocketRequester;

    public MyService(RSocketRequester.Builder rsocketRequesterBuilder) {
        this.rsocketRequester = rsocketRequesterBuilder
                .connectTcp("example.org", 9898).cache();
    }

    public Mono<User> someRSocketCall(String name) {
        return this.rsocketRequester.flatMap(req ->
                    req.route("user").data(name).retrieveMono(User.class));
    }

}
```

### 4.9. Security

If [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) is on the classpath, then web applications are secured by default. Spring Boot relies on Spring Security’s content-negotiation strategy to determine whether to use `httpBasic` or `formLogin`. To add method-level security to a web application, you can also add `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` with your desired settings. Additional information can be found in the [Spring Security Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-method).

The default `UserDetailsService` has a single user. The user name is `user`, and the password is random and is printed at INFO level when the application starts, as shown in the following example:

```
Using generated security password: 78fa095d-3f4c-48b1-ad50-e24c31d5cf35
```

|      | If you fine-tune your logging configuration, ensure that the `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security` category is set to log `INFO`-level messages. Otherwise, the default password is not printed. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can change the username and password by providing a `spring.security.user.name` and `spring.security.user.password`.

The basic features you get by default in a web application are:

- A `UserDetailsService` (or `ReactiveUserDetailsService` in case of a WebFlux application) bean with in-memory store and a single user with a generated password (see [`SecurityProperties.User`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/SecurityProperties.User.html) for the properties of the user).
- Form-based login or HTTP Basic security (depending on the `Accept` header in the request) for the entire application (including actuator endpoints if actuator is on the classpath).
- A `DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher` for publishing authentication events.

You can provide a different `AuthenticationEventPublisher` by adding a bean for it.

#### 4.9.1. MVC Security

The default security configuration is implemented in `SecurityAutoConfiguration` and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration`. `SecurityAutoConfiguration` imports `SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration` for web security and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration` configures authentication, which is also relevant in non-web applications. To switch off the default web application security configuration completely or to combine multiple Spring Security components such as OAuth 2 Client and Resource Server, add a bean of type `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` (doing so does not disable the `UserDetailsService` configuration or Actuator’s security).

To also switch off the `UserDetailsService` configuration, you can add a bean of type `UserDetailsService`, `AuthenticationProvider`, or `AuthenticationManager`.

Access rules can be overridden by adding a custom `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources. `EndpointRequest` can be used to create a `RequestMatcher` that is based on the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property. `PathRequest` can be used to create a `RequestMatcher` for resources in commonly used locations.

#### 4.9.2. WebFlux Security

Similar to Spring MVC applications, you can secure your WebFlux applications by adding the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency. The default security configuration is implemented in `ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration` and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration`. `ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration` imports `WebFluxSecurityConfiguration` for web security and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration` configures authentication, which is also relevant in non-web applications. To switch off the default web application security configuration completely, you can add a bean of type `WebFilterChainProxy` (doing so does not disable the `UserDetailsService` configuration or Actuator’s security).

To also switch off the `UserDetailsService` configuration, you can add a bean of type `ReactiveUserDetailsService` or `ReactiveAuthenticationManager`.

Access rules and the use of multiple Spring Security components such as OAuth 2 Client and Resource Server can be configured by adding a custom `SecurityWebFilterChain` bean. Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources. `EndpointRequest` can be used to create a `ServerWebExchangeMatcher` that is based on the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property.

`PathRequest` can be used to create a `ServerWebExchangeMatcher` for resources in commonly used locations.

For example, you can customize your security configuration by adding something like:

```java
@Bean
public SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    return http
        .authorizeExchange()
            .matchers(PathRequest.toStaticResources().atCommonLocations()).permitAll()
            .pathMatchers("/foo", "/bar")
                .authenticated().and()
            .formLogin().and()
        .build();
}
```

#### 4.9.3. OAuth2

[OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) is a widely used authorization framework that is supported by Spring.

##### Client

If you have `spring-security-oauth2-client` on your classpath, you can take advantage of some auto-configuration to set up an OAuth2/Open ID Connect clients. This configuration makes use of the properties under `OAuth2ClientProperties`. The same properties are applicable to both servlet and reactive applications.

You can register multiple OAuth2 clients and providers under the `spring.security.oauth2.client` prefix, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-id=abcd
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-secret=password
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-name=Client for user scope
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.provider=my-oauth-provider
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.scope=user
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.redirect-uri=https://my-redirect-uri.com
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-authentication-method=basic
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.authorization-grant-type=authorization_code

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-id=abcd
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-secret=password
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-name=Client for email scope
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.provider=my-oauth-provider
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.scope=email
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.redirect-uri=https://my-redirect-uri.com
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-authentication-method=basic
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.authorization-grant-type=authorization_code

spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.authorization-uri=https://my-auth-server/oauth/authorize
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.token-uri=https://my-auth-server/oauth/token
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-info-uri=https://my-auth-server/userinfo
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-info-authentication-method=header
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.jwk-set-uri=https://my-auth-server/token_keys
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-name-attribute=name
```

For OpenID Connect providers that support [OpenID Connect discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html), the configuration can be further simplified. The provider needs to be configured with an `issuer-uri` which is the URI that the it asserts as its Issuer Identifier. For example, if the `issuer-uri` provided is "https://example.com", then an `OpenID Provider Configuration Request` will be made to "https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration". The result is expected to be an `OpenID Provider Configuration Response`. The following example shows how an OpenID Connect Provider can be configured with the `issuer-uri`:

```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.oidc-provider.issuer-uri=https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/
```

By default, Spring Security’s `OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter` only processes URLs matching `/login/oauth2/code/*`. If you want to customize the `redirect-uri` to use a different pattern, you need to provide configuration to process that custom pattern. For example, for servlet applications, you can add your own `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` that resembles the following:

```java
public class OAuth2LoginSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .oauth2Login()
                .redirectionEndpoint()
                    .baseUri("/custom-callback");
    }
}
```

###### OAuth2 client registration for common providers

For common OAuth2 and OpenID providers, including Google, Github, Facebook, and Okta, we provide a set of provider defaults (`google`, `github`, `facebook`, and `okta`, respectively).

If you do not need to customize these providers, you can set the `provider` attribute to the one for which you need to infer defaults. Also, if the key for the client registration matches a default supported provider, Spring Boot infers that as well.

In other words, the two configurations in the following example use the Google provider:

```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client.client-id=abcd
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client.client-secret=password
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client.provider=google

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=abcd
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=password
```

##### Resource Server

If you have `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` on your classpath, Spring Boot can set up an OAuth2 Resource Server. For JWT configuration, a JWK Set URI or OIDC Issuer URI needs to be specified, as shown in the following examples:

```properties
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=https://example.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/
```

|      | If the authorization server does not support a JWK Set URI, you can configure the resource server with the Public Key used for verifying the signature of the JWT. This can be done using the `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.public-key-location` property, where the value needs to point to a file containing the public key in the PEM-encoded x509 format. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The same properties are applicable for both servlet and reactive applications.

Alternatively, you can define your own `JwtDecoder` bean for servlet applications or a `ReactiveJwtDecoder` for reactive applications.

In cases where opaque tokens are used instead of JWTs, you can configure the following properties to validate tokens via introspection:

```properties
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaquetoken.introspection-uri=https://example.com/check-token
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaquetoken.client-id=my-client-id
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaquetoken.client-secret=my-client-secret
```

Again, the same properties are applicable for both servlet and reactive applications.

Alternatively, you can define your own `OpaqueTokenIntrospector` bean for servlet applications or a `ReactiveOpaqueTokenIntrospector` for reactive applications.

##### Authorization Server

Currently, Spring Security does not provide support for implementing an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. However, this functionality is available from the [Spring Security OAuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security-oauth) project, which will eventually be superseded by Spring Security completely. Until then, you can use the `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure` module to easily set up an OAuth 2.0 authorization server; see its [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-oauth2-boot) for instructions.

#### 4.9.4. SAML 2.0

##### Relying Party

If you have `spring-security-saml2-service-provider` on your classpath, you can take advantage of some auto-configuration to set up a SAML 2.0 Relying Party. This configuration makes use of the properties under `Saml2RelyingPartyProperties`.

A relying party registration represents a paired configuration between an Identity Provider, IDP, and a Service Provider, SP. You can register multiple relying parties under the `spring.security.saml2.relyingparty` prefix, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party1.signing.credentials[0].private-key-location=path-to-private-key
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party1.signing.credentials[0].certificate-location=path-to-certificate
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party1.identityprovider.verification.credentials[0].certificate-location=path-to-verification-cert
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party1.identityprovider.entity-id=remote-idp-entity-id1
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party1.identityprovider.sso-url=https://remoteidp1.sso.url

spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party2.signing.credentials[0].private-key-location=path-to-private-key
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party2.signing.credentials[0].certificate-location=path-to-certificate
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party2.identityprovider.verification.credentials[0].certificate-location=path-to-other-verification-cert
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party2.identityprovider.entity-id=remote-idp-entity-id2
spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.my-relying-party2.identityprovider.sso-url=https://remoteidp2.sso.url
```

#### 4.9.5. Actuator Security

For security purposes, all actuators other than `/health` and `/info` are disabled by default. The `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` property can be used to enable the actuators.

If Spring Security is on the classpath and no other WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter is present, all actuators other than `/health` and `/info` are secured by Spring Boot auto-configuration. If you define a custom `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, Spring Boot auto-configuration will back off and you will be in full control of actuator access rules.

|      | Before setting the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include`, ensure that the exposed actuators do not contain sensitive information and/or are secured by placing them behind a firewall or by something like Spring Security. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Cross Site Request Forgery Protection

Since Spring Boot relies on Spring Security’s defaults, CSRF protection is turned on by default. This means that the actuator endpoints that require a `POST` (shutdown and loggers endpoints), `PUT` or `DELETE` will get a 403 forbidden error when the default security configuration is in use.

|      | We recommend disabling CSRF protection completely only if you are creating a service that is used by non-browser clients. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Additional information about CSRF protection can be found in the [Spring Security Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#csrf).

### 4.10. Working with SQL Databases

The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) provides extensive support for working with SQL databases, from direct JDBC access using `JdbcTemplate` to complete “object relational mapping” technologies such as Hibernate. [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) provides an additional level of functionality: creating `Repository` implementations directly from interfaces and using conventions to generate queries from your method names.

#### 4.10.1. Configure a DataSource

Java’s `javax.sql.DataSource` interface provides a standard method of working with database connections. Traditionally, a 'DataSource' uses a `URL` along with some credentials to establish a database connection.

|      | See [the “How-to” section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-a-datasource) for more advanced examples, typically to take full control over the configuration of the DataSource. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Embedded Database Support

It is often convenient to develop applications by using an in-memory embedded database. Obviously, in-memory databases do not provide persistent storage. You need to populate your database when your application starts and be prepared to throw away data when your application ends.

|      | The “How-to” section includes a [section on how to initialize a database](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-database-initialization). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot can auto-configure embedded [H2](https://www.h2database.com/), [HSQL](http://hsqldb.org/), and [Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/) databases. You need not provide any connection URLs. You need only include a build dependency to the embedded database that you want to use.

|      | If you are using this feature in your tests, you may notice that the same database is reused by your whole test suite regardless of the number of application contexts that you use. If you want to make sure that each context has a separate embedded database, you should set `spring.datasource.generate-unique-name` to `true`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

For example, the typical POM dependencies would be as follows:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hsqldb</groupId>
    <artifactId>hsqldb</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

|      | You need a dependency on `spring-jdbc` for an embedded database to be auto-configured. In this example, it is pulled in transitively through `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If, for whatever reason, you do configure the connection URL for an embedded database, take care to ensure that the database’s automatic shutdown is disabled. If you use H2, you should use `DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE` to do so. If you use HSQLDB, you should ensure that `shutdown=true` is not used. Disabling the database’s automatic shutdown lets Spring Boot control when the database is closed, thereby ensuring that it happens once access to the database is no longer needed. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Connection to a Production Database

Production database connections can also be auto-configured by using a pooling `DataSource`. Spring Boot uses the following algorithm for choosing a specific implementation:

1. We prefer [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) for its performance and concurrency. If HikariCP is available, we always choose it.
2. Otherwise, if the Tomcat pooling `DataSource` is available, we use it.
3. If neither HikariCP nor the Tomcat pooling datasource are available and if [Commons DBCP2](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/) is available, we use it.

If you use the `spring-boot-starter-jdbc` or `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` “starters”, you automatically get a dependency to `HikariCP`.

|      | You can bypass that algorithm completely and specify the connection pool to use by setting the `spring.datasource.type` property. This is especially important if you run your application in a Tomcat container, as `tomcat-jdbc` is provided by default. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Additional connection pools can always be configured manually. If you define your own `DataSource` bean, auto-configuration does not occur. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

DataSource configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `spring.datasource.*`. For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
spring.datasource.username=dbuser
spring.datasource.password=dbpass
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
```

|      | You should at least specify the URL by setting the `spring.datasource.url` property. Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to auto-configure an embedded database. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | You often do not need to specify the `driver-class-name`, since Spring Boot can deduce it for most databases from the `url`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | For a pooling `DataSource` to be created, we need to be able to verify that a valid `Driver` class is available, so we check for that before doing anything. In other words, if you set `spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`, then that class has to be loadable. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

See [`DataSourceProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jdbc/DataSourceProperties.java) for more of the supported options. These are the standard options that work regardless of the actual implementation. It is also possible to fine-tune implementation-specific settings by using their respective prefix (`spring.datasource.hikari.*`, `spring.datasource.tomcat.*`, and `spring.datasource.dbcp2.*`). Refer to the documentation of the connection pool implementation you are using for more details.

For instance, if you use the [Tomcat connection pool](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#Common_Attributes), you could customize many additional settings, as shown in the following example:

```properties
# Number of ms to wait before throwing an exception if no connection is available.
spring.datasource.tomcat.max-wait=10000

# Maximum number of active connections that can be allocated from this pool at the same time.
spring.datasource.tomcat.max-active=50

# Validate the connection before borrowing it from the pool.
spring.datasource.tomcat.test-on-borrow=true
```

##### Connection to a JNDI DataSource

If you deploy your Spring Boot application to an Application Server, you might want to configure and manage your DataSource by using your Application Server’s built-in features and access it by using JNDI.

The `spring.datasource.jndi-name` property can be used as an alternative to the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties to access the `DataSource` from a specific JNDI location. For example, the following section in `application.properties` shows how you can access a JBoss AS defined `DataSource`:

```properties
spring.datasource.jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/customers
```

#### 4.10.2. Using JdbcTemplate

Spring’s `JdbcTemplate` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` classes are auto-configured, and you can `@Autowire` them directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
    }

    // ...

}
```

You can customize some properties of the template by using the `spring.jdbc.template.*` properties, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.jdbc.template.max-rows=500
```

|      | The `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` reuses the same `JdbcTemplate` instance behind the scenes. If more than one `JdbcTemplate` is defined and no primary candidate exists, the `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` is not auto-configured. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.10.3. JPA and Spring Data JPA

The Java Persistence API is a standard technology that lets you “map” objects to relational databases. The `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` POM provides a quick way to get started. It provides the following key dependencies:

- Hibernate: One of the most popular JPA implementations.
- Spring Data JPA: Helps you to implement JPA-based repositories.
- Spring ORM: Core ORM support from the Spring Framework.

|      | We do not go into too many details of JPA or [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) here. You can follow the [“Accessing Data with JPA”](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/) guide from [spring.io](https://spring.io/) and read the [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) and [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/) reference documentation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Entity Classes

Traditionally, JPA “Entity” classes are specified in a `persistence.xml` file. With Spring Boot, this file is not necessary and “Entity Scanning” is used instead. By default, all packages below your main configuration class (the one annotated with `@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication`) are searched.

Any classes annotated with `@Entity`, `@Embeddable`, or `@MappedSuperclass` are considered. A typical entity class resembles the following example:

```java
package com.example.myapp.domain;

import java.io.Serializable;
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class City implements Serializable {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String name;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String state;

    // ... additional members, often include @OneToMany mappings

    protected City() {
        // no-args constructor required by JPA spec
        // this one is protected since it shouldn't be used directly
    }

    public City(String name, String state) {
        this.name = name;
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return this.state;
    }

    // ... etc

}
```

|      | You can customize entity scanning locations by using the `@EntityScan` annotation. See the “[Separate @Entity Definitions from Spring Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-separate-entity-definitions-from-spring-configuration)” how-to. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Spring Data JPA Repositories

[Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) repositories are interfaces that you can define to access data. JPA queries are created automatically from your method names. For example, a `CityRepository` interface might declare a `findAllByState(String state)` method to find all the cities in a given state.

For more complex queries, you can annotate your method with Spring Data’s [`Query`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/Query.html) annotation.

Spring Data repositories usually extend from the [`Repository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/repository/Repository.html) or [`CrudRepository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html) interfaces. If you use auto-configuration, repositories are searched from the package containing your main configuration class (the one annotated with `@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication`) down.

The following example shows a typical Spring Data repository interface definition:

```java
package com.example.myapp.domain;

import org.springframework.data.domain.*;
import org.springframework.data.repository.*;

public interface CityRepository extends Repository<City, Long> {

    Page<City> findAll(Pageable pageable);

    City findByNameAndStateAllIgnoringCase(String name, String state);

}
```

Spring Data JPA repositories support three different modes of bootstrapping: default, deferred, and lazy. To enable deferred or lazy bootstrapping, set the `spring.data.jpa.repositories.bootstrap-mode` property to `deferred` or `lazy` respectively. When using deferred or lazy bootstrapping, the auto-configured `EntityManagerFactoryBuilder` will use the context’s `AsyncTaskExecutor`, if any, as the bootstrap executor. If more than one exists, the one named `applicationTaskExecutor` will be used.

|      | We have barely scratched the surface of Spring Data JPA. For complete details, see the [Spring Data JPA reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc/docs/1.1.9.RELEASE/reference/html/). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Creating and Dropping JPA Databases

By default, JPA databases are automatically created **only** if you use an embedded database (H2, HSQL, or Derby). You can explicitly configure JPA settings by using `spring.jpa.*` properties. For example, to create and drop tables you can add the following line to your `application.properties`:

```
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
```

|      | Hibernate’s own internal property name for this (if you happen to remember it better) is `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto`. You can set it, along with other Hibernate native properties, by using `spring.jpa.properties.*` (the prefix is stripped before adding them to the entity manager). The following line shows an example of setting JPA properties for Hibernate: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

```
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers=true
```

The line in the preceding example passes a value of `true` for the `hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers` property to the Hibernate entity manager.

By default, the DDL execution (or validation) is deferred until the `ApplicationContext` has started. There is also a `spring.jpa.generate-ddl` flag, but it is not used if Hibernate auto-configuration is active, because the `ddl-auto` settings are more fine-grained.

##### Open EntityManager in View

If you are running a web application, Spring Boot by default registers [`OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/support/OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor.html) to apply the “Open EntityManager in View” pattern, to allow for lazy loading in web views. If you do not want this behavior, you should set `spring.jpa.open-in-view` to `false` in your `application.properties`.

#### 4.10.4. Spring Data JDBC

Spring Data includes repository support for JDBC and will automatically generate SQL for the methods on `CrudRepository`. For more advanced queries, a `@Query` annotation is provided.

Spring Boot will auto-configure Spring Data’s JDBC repositories when the necessary dependencies are on the classpath. They can be added to your project with a single dependency on `spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc`. If necessary, you can take control of Spring Data JDBC’s configuration by adding the `@EnableJdbcRepositories` annotation or a `JdbcConfiguration` subclass to your application.

|      | For complete details of Spring Data JDBC, please refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc/docs/1.1.9.RELEASE/reference/html/). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.10.5. Using H2’s Web Console

The [H2 database](https://www.h2database.com/) provides a [browser-based console](https://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html#h2_console) that Spring Boot can auto-configure for you. The console is auto-configured when the following conditions are met:

- You are developing a servlet-based web application.
- `com.h2database:h2` is on the classpath.
- You are using [Spring Boot’s developer tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools).

|      | If you are not using Spring Boot’s developer tools but would still like to make use of H2’s console, you can configure the `spring.h2.console.enabled` property with a value of `true`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | The H2 console is only intended for use during development, so you should take care to ensure that `spring.h2.console.enabled` is not set to `true` in production. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Changing the H2 Console’s Path

By default, the console is available at `/h2-console`. You can customize the console’s path by using the `spring.h2.console.path` property.

#### 4.10.6. Using jOOQ

jOOQ Object Oriented Querying ([jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/)) is a popular product from [Data Geekery](https://www.datageekery.com/) which generates Java code from your database and lets you build type-safe SQL queries through its fluent API. Both the commercial and open source editions can be used with Spring Boot.

##### Code Generation

In order to use jOOQ type-safe queries, you need to generate Java classes from your database schema. You can follow the instructions in the [jOOQ user manual](https://www.jooq.org/doc/3.12.4/manual-single-page/#jooq-in-7-steps-step3). If you use the `jooq-codegen-maven` plugin and you also use the `spring-boot-starter-parent` “parent POM”, you can safely omit the plugin’s `` tag. You can also use Spring Boot-defined version variables (such as `h2.version`) to declare the plugin’s database dependency. The following listing shows an example:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jooq</groupId>
    <artifactId>jooq-codegen-maven</artifactId>
    <executions>
        ...
    </executions>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
            <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
            <version>${h2.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    <configuration>
        <jdbc>
            <driver>org.h2.Driver</driver>
            <url>jdbc:h2:~/yourdatabase</url>
        </jdbc>
        <generator>
            ...
        </generator>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

##### Using DSLContext

The fluent API offered by jOOQ is initiated through the `org.jooq.DSLContext` interface. Spring Boot auto-configures a `DSLContext` as a Spring Bean and connects it to your application `DataSource`. To use the `DSLContext`, you can `@Autowire` it, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class JooqExample implements CommandLineRunner {

    private final DSLContext create;

    @Autowired
    public JooqExample(DSLContext dslContext) {
        this.create = dslContext;
    }

}
```

|      | The jOOQ manual tends to use a variable named `create` to hold the `DSLContext`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can then use the `DSLContext` to construct your queries, as shown in the following example:

```java
public List<GregorianCalendar> authorsBornAfter1980() {
    return this.create.selectFrom(AUTHOR)
        .where(AUTHOR.DATE_OF_BIRTH.greaterThan(new GregorianCalendar(1980, 0, 1)))
        .fetch(AUTHOR.DATE_OF_BIRTH);
}
```

##### jOOQ SQL Dialect

Unless the `spring.jooq.sql-dialect` property has been configured, Spring Boot determines the SQL dialect to use for your datasource. If Spring Boot could not detect the dialect, it uses `DEFAULT`.

|      | Spring Boot can only auto-configure dialects supported by the open source version of jOOQ. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Customizing jOOQ

More advanced customizations can be achieved by defining your own `@Bean` definitions, which is used when the jOOQ `Configuration` is created. You can define beans for the following jOOQ Types:

- `ConnectionProvider`
- `ExecutorProvider`
- `TransactionProvider`
- `RecordMapperProvider`
- `RecordUnmapperProvider`
- `Settings`
- `RecordListenerProvider`
- `ExecuteListenerProvider`
- `VisitListenerProvider`
- `TransactionListenerProvider`

You can also create your own `org.jooq.Configuration` `@Bean` if you want to take complete control of the jOOQ configuration.

### 4.11. Working with NoSQL Technologies

Spring Data provides additional projects that help you access a variety of NoSQL technologies, including:

- [MongoDB](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb)
- [Neo4J](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-neo4j)
- [Elasticsearch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-elasticsearch)
- [Solr](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-solr)
- [Redis](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-redis)
- [GemFire](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-gemfire) or [Geode](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode)
- [Cassandra](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-cassandra)
- [Couchbase](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-couchbase)
- [LDAP](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-ldap)

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, Elasticsearch, Solr Cassandra, Couchbase, and LDAP. You can make use of the other projects, but you must configure them yourself. Refer to the appropriate reference documentation at [spring.io/projects/spring-data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data).

#### 4.11.1. Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is a cache, message broker, and richly-featured key-value store. Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for the [Lettuce](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/) and [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/) client libraries and the abstractions on top of them provided by [Spring Data Redis](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis).

There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` “Starter” for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way. By default, it uses [Lettuce](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/). That starter handles both traditional and reactive applications.

|      | we also provide a `spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive` “Starter” for consistency with the other stores with reactive support. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Connecting to Redis

You can inject an auto-configured `RedisConnectionFactory`, `StringRedisTemplate`, or vanilla `RedisTemplate` instance as you would any other Spring Bean. By default, the instance tries to connect to a Redis server at `localhost:6379`. The following listing shows an example of such a bean:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private StringRedisTemplate template;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(StringRedisTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }

    // ...

}
```

|      | You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `LettuceClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer` for more advanced customizations. If you use Jedis, `JedisClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer` is also available. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you add your own `@Bean` of any of the auto-configured types, it replaces the default (except in the case of `RedisTemplate`, when the exclusion is based on the bean name, `redisTemplate`, not its type). By default, if `commons-pool2` is on the classpath, you get a pooled connection factory.

#### 4.11.2. MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an open-source NoSQL document database that uses a JSON-like schema instead of traditional table-based relational data. Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with MongoDB, including the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` and `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb-reactive` “Starters”.

##### Connecting to a MongoDB Database

To access Mongo databases, you can inject an auto-configured `org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDbFactory`. By default, the instance tries to connect to a MongoDB server at `mongodb://localhost/test`. The following example shows how to connect to a MongoDB database:

```java
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDbFactory;
import com.mongodb.DB;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final MongoDbFactory mongo;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(MongoDbFactory mongo) {
        this.mongo = mongo;
    }

    // ...

    public void example() {
        DB db = mongo.getDb();
        // ...
    }

}
```

You can set the `spring.data.mongodb.uri` property to change the URL and configure additional settings such as the *replica set*, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://user:secret@mongo1.example.com:12345,mongo2.example.com:23456/test
```

Alternatively, as long as you use Mongo 2.x, you can specify a `host`/`port`. For example, you might declare the following settings in your `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.host=mongoserver
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
```

If you have defined your own `MongoClient`, it will be used to auto-configure a suitable `MongoDbFactory`. Both `com.mongodb.MongoClient` and `com.mongodb.client.MongoClient` are supported.

|      | If you use the Mongo 3.0 Java driver, `spring.data.mongodb.host` and `spring.data.mongodb.port` are not supported. In such cases, `spring.data.mongodb.uri` should be used to provide all of the configuration. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If `spring.data.mongodb.port` is not specified, the default of `27017` is used. You could delete this line from the example shown earlier. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you do not use Spring Data Mongo, you can inject `com.mongodb.MongoClient` beans instead of using `MongoDbFactory`. If you want to take complete control of establishing the MongoDB connection, you can also declare your own `MongoDbFactory` or `MongoClient` bean. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you are using the reactive driver, Netty is required for SSL. The auto-configuration configures this factory automatically if Netty is available and the factory to use hasn’t been customized already. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### MongoTemplate

[Spring Data MongoDB](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb) provides a [`MongoTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/MongoTemplate.html) class that is very similar in its design to Spring’s `JdbcTemplate`. As with `JdbcTemplate`, Spring Boot auto-configures a bean for you to inject the template, as follows:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final MongoTemplate mongoTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(MongoTemplate mongoTemplate) {
        this.mongoTemplate = mongoTemplate;
    }

    // ...

}
```

See the [`MongoOperations` Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/MongoOperations.html) for complete details.

##### Spring Data MongoDB Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for MongoDB. As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed automatically, based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB share the same common infrastructure. You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now a Mongo data class rather than a JPA `@Entity`, it works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

```java
package com.example.myapp.domain;

import org.springframework.data.domain.*;
import org.springframework.data.repository.*;

public interface CityRepository extends Repository<City, Long> {

    Page<City> findAll(Pageable pageable);

    City findByNameAndStateAllIgnoringCase(String name, String state);

}
```

|      | You can customize document scanning locations by using the `@EntityScan` annotation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | For complete details of Spring Data MongoDB, including its rich object mapping technologies, refer to its [reference documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Embedded Mongo

Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for [Embedded Mongo](https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo). To use it in your Spring Boot application, add a dependency on `de.flapdoodle.embed:de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo`.

The port that Mongo listens on can be configured by setting the `spring.data.mongodb.port` property. To use a randomly allocated free port, use a value of 0. The `MongoClient` created by `MongoAutoConfiguration` is automatically configured to use the randomly allocated port.

|      | If you do not configure a custom port, the embedded support uses a random port (rather than 27017) by default. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you have SLF4J on the classpath, the output produced by Mongo is automatically routed to a logger named `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.embedded.EmbeddedMongo`.

You can declare your own `IMongodConfig` and `IRuntimeConfig` beans to take control of the Mongo instance’s configuration and logging routing. The download configuration can be customized by declaring a `DownloadConfigBuilderCustomizer` bean.

#### 4.11.3. Neo4j

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is an open-source NoSQL graph database that uses a rich data model of nodes connected by first class relationships, which is better suited for connected big data than traditional RDBMS approaches. Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with Neo4j, including the `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j` “Starter”.

##### Connecting to a Neo4j Database

To access a Neo4j server, you can inject an auto-configured `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session`. By default, the instance tries to connect to a Neo4j server at `localhost:7687` using the Bolt protocol. The following example shows how to inject a Neo4j `Session`:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final Session session;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(Session session) {
        this.session = session;
    }

    // ...

}
```

You can configure the uri and credentials to use by setting the `spring.data.neo4j.*` properties, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.data.neo4j.uri=bolt://my-server:7687
spring.data.neo4j.username=neo4j
spring.data.neo4j.password=secret
```

You can take full control over the session creation by adding either an `org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration` bean or an `org.neo4j.ogm.session.SessionFactory` bean.

##### Using the Embedded Mode

If you add `org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-embedded-driver` to the dependencies of your application, Spring Boot automatically configures an in-process embedded instance of Neo4j that does not persist any data when your application shuts down.

|      | As the embedded Neo4j OGM driver does not provide the Neo4j kernel itself, you have to declare `org.neo4j:neo4j` as dependency yourself. Refer to [the Neo4j OGM documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/current/reference/#reference:getting-started) for a list of compatible versions. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The embedded driver takes precedence over the other drivers when there are multiple drivers on the classpath. You can explicitly disable the embedded mode by setting `spring.data.neo4j.embedded.enabled=false`.

[Data Neo4j Tests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-neo4j-test) automatically make use of an embedded Neo4j instance if the embedded driver and Neo4j kernel are on the classpath as described above.

|      | You can enable persistence for the embedded mode by providing a path to a database file in your configuration, e.g. `spring.data.neo4j.uri=file://var/tmp/graph.db`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Using Native Types

Neo4j-OGM can map some types, like those in `java.time.*`, to `String`-based properties or to one of the native types that Neo4j provides. For backwards compatibility reasons the default for Neo4j-OGM is to use a `String`-based representation. To use native types, add a dependency on either `org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-bolt-native-types` or `org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-embedded-native-types`, and configure the `spring.data.neo4j.use-native-types` property as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.data.neo4j.use-native-types=true
```

##### Neo4jSession

By default, if you are running a web application, the session is bound to the thread for the entire processing of the request (that is, it uses the "Open Session in View" pattern). If you do not want this behavior, add the following line to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.data.neo4j.open-in-view=false
```

##### Spring Data Neo4j Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Neo4j.

Spring Data Neo4j shares the common infrastructure with Spring Data JPA as many other Spring Data modules do. You could take the JPA example from earlier and define `City` as Neo4j OGM `@NodeEntity` rather than JPA `@Entity` and the repository abstraction works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

```java
package com.example.myapp.domain;

import java.util.Optional;

import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.*;

public interface CityRepository extends Neo4jRepository<City, Long> {

    Optional<City> findOneByNameAndState(String name, String state);

}
```

The `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j` “Starter” enables the repository support as well as transaction management. You can customize the locations to look for repositories and entities by using `@EnableNeo4jRepositories` and `@EntityScan` respectively on a `@Configuration`-bean.

|      | For complete details of Spring Data Neo4j, including its object mapping technologies, refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/5.2.9.RELEASE/reference/html/). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.11.4. Solr

[Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) is a search engine. Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for the Solr 5 client library and the abstractions on top of it provided by [Spring Data Solr](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-solr). There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-solr` “Starter” for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to Solr

You can inject an auto-configured `SolrClient` instance as you would any other Spring bean. By default, the instance tries to connect to a server at `localhost:8983/solr`. The following example shows how to inject a Solr bean:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private SolrClient solr;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(SolrClient solr) {
        this.solr = solr;
    }

    // ...

}
```

If you add your own `@Bean` of type `SolrClient`, it replaces the default.

##### Spring Data Solr Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Apache Solr. As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are automatically constructed for you based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Solr share the same common infrastructure. You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now a `@SolrDocument` class rather than a JPA `@Entity`, it works in the same way.

IP: For complete details of Spring Data Solr, refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/solr/docs/4.1.9.RELEASE/reference/html/).

#### 4.11.5. Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is an open source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for Elasticsearch.

Spring Boot supports several clients:

- The official Java "Low Level" and "High Level" REST clients
- The `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` provided by Spring Data Elasticsearch

The transport client is still available but its support has been deprecated in [Spring Data Elasticsearch](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-elasticsearch) and Elasticsearch itself. It will be removed in a future release. Spring Boot provides a dedicated “Starter”, `spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch`.

The [Jest](https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest) client has been deprecated as well, since both Elasticsearch and Spring Data Elasticsearch provide official support for REST clients.

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch using REST clients

Elasticsearch ships [two different REST clients](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/index.html) that you can use to query a cluster: the "Low Level" client and the "High Level" client.

If you have the `org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-client` dependency on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a `RestClient` bean that by default targets `localhost:9200`. You can further tune how `RestClient` is configured, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.elasticsearch.rest.uris=https://search.example.com:9200
spring.elasticsearch.rest.read-timeout=10s
spring.elasticsearch.rest.username=user
spring.elasticsearch.rest.password=secret
```

You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `RestClientBuilderCustomizer` for more advanced customizations. To take full control over the registration, define a `RestClient` bean.

If you have the `org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client` dependency on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure a `RestHighLevelClient`, which wraps any existing `RestClient` bean, reusing its HTTP configuration.

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch using Reactive REST clients

[Spring Data Elasticsearch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-elasticsearch) ships `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` for querying Elasticsearch instances in a reactive fashion. It is built on top of WebFlux’s `WebClient`, so both `spring-boot-starter-elasticsearch` and `spring-boot-starter-webflux` dependencies are useful to enable this support.

By default, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` bean that targets `localhost:9200`. You can further tune how it is configured, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.data.elasticsearch.client.reactive.endpoints=search.example.com:9200
spring.data.elasticsearch.client.reactive.use-ssl=true
spring.data.elasticsearch.client.reactive.socket-timeout=10s
spring.data.elasticsearch.client.reactive.username=user
spring.data.elasticsearch.client.reactive.password=secret
```

If the configuration properties are not enough and you’d like to fully control the client configuration, you can register a custom `ClientConfiguration` bean.

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch using Jest

Now that Spring Boot supports the official `RestHighLevelClient`, Jest support is deprecated.

If you have `Jest` on the classpath, you can inject an auto-configured `JestClient` that by default targets `localhost:9200`. You can further tune how the client is configured, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.elasticsearch.jest.uris=https://search.example.com:9200
spring.elasticsearch.jest.read-timeout=10000
spring.elasticsearch.jest.username=user
spring.elasticsearch.jest.password=secret
```

You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `HttpClientConfigBuilderCustomizer` for more advanced customizations. The following example tunes additional HTTP settings:

```java
static class HttpSettingsCustomizer implements HttpClientConfigBuilderCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(HttpClientConfig.Builder builder) {
        builder.maxTotalConnection(100).defaultMaxTotalConnectionPerRoute(5);
    }

}
```

To take full control over the registration, define a `JestClient` bean.

##### Connecting to Elasticsearch by Using Spring Data

To connect to Elasticsearch, a `RestHighLevelClient` bean must be defined, auto-configured by Spring Boot or manually provided by the application (see previous sections). With this configuration in place, an `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` can be injected like any other Spring bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final ElasticsearchRestTemplate template;

    public MyBean(ElasticsearchRestTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }

    // ...

}
```

In the presence of `spring-data-elasticsearch` and the required dependencies for using a `WebClient` (typically `spring-boot-starter-webflux`), Spring Boot can also auto-configure a [ReactiveElasticsearchClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-connecting-to-elasticsearch-reactive-rest) and a `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` as beans. They are the reactive equivalent of the other REST clients.

##### Spring Data Elasticsearch Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Elasticsearch. As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed for you automatically based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Elasticsearch share the same common infrastructure. You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now an Elasticsearch `@Document` class rather than a JPA `@Entity`, it works in the same way.

|      | For complete details of Spring Data Elasticsearch, refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Elasticsearch repositories, using the `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` or `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` beans. Most likely those beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot given the required dependencies are present.

If you wish to use your own template for backing the Elasticsearch repositories, you can add your own `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` or `ElasticsearchOperations` `@Bean`, as long as it is named `"elasticsearchTemplate"`. Same applies to `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` and `ReactiveElasticsearchOperations`, with the bean name `"reactiveElasticsearchTemplate"`.

You can choose to disable the repositories support with the following property:

```properties
spring.data.elasticsearch.repositories.enabled=false
```

#### 4.11.6. Cassandra

[Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is an open source, distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers. Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Cassandra and the abstractions on top of it provided by [Spring Data Cassandra](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra). There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-cassandra` “Starter” for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to Cassandra

You can inject an auto-configured `CassandraTemplate` or a Cassandra `Session` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean. The `spring.data.cassandra.*` properties can be used to customize the connection. Generally, you provide `keyspace-name` and `contact-points` properties, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.data.cassandra.keyspace-name=mykeyspace
spring.data.cassandra.contact-points=cassandrahost1,cassandrahost2
```

You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `ClusterBuilderCustomizer` for more advanced customizations.

The following code listing shows how to inject a Cassandra bean:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private CassandraTemplate template;

    public MyBean(CassandraTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }

    // ...

}
```

If you add your own `@Bean` of type `CassandraTemplate`, it replaces the default.

##### Spring Data Cassandra Repositories

Spring Data includes basic repository support for Cassandra. Currently, this is more limited than the JPA repositories discussed earlier and needs to annotate finder methods with `@Query`.

|      | For complete details of Spring Data Cassandra, refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.11.7. Couchbase

[Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) is an open-source, distributed, multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database that is optimized for interactive applications. Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Couchbase and the abstractions on top of it provided by [Spring Data Couchbase](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-couchbase). There are `spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase` and `spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase-reactive` “Starters” for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to Couchbase

You can get a `Bucket` and `Cluster` by adding the Couchbase SDK and some configuration. The `spring.couchbase.*` properties can be used to customize the connection. Generally, you provide the bootstrap hosts, bucket name, and password, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.couchbase.bootstrap-hosts=my-host-1,192.168.1.123
spring.couchbase.bucket.name=my-bucket
spring.couchbase.bucket.password=secret
```

|      | You need to provide *at least* the bootstrap host(s), in which case the bucket name is `default` and the password is an empty String. Alternatively, you can define your own `org.springframework.data.couchbase.config.CouchbaseConfigurer` `@Bean` to take control over the whole configuration. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

It is also possible to customize some of the `CouchbaseEnvironment` settings. For instance, the following configuration changes the timeout to use to open a new `Bucket` and enables SSL support:

```properties
spring.couchbase.env.timeouts.connect=3000
spring.couchbase.env.ssl.key-store=/location/of/keystore.jks
spring.couchbase.env.ssl.key-store-password=secret
```

Check the `spring.couchbase.env.*` properties for more details.

##### Spring Data Couchbase Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Couchbase. For complete details of Spring Data Couchbase, refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/couchbase/docs/current/reference/html/).

You can inject an auto-configured `CouchbaseTemplate` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, provided a *default* `CouchbaseConfigurer` is available (which happens when you enable Couchbase support, as explained earlier).

The following examples shows how to inject a Couchbase bean:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final CouchbaseTemplate template;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(CouchbaseTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }

    // ...

}
```

There are a few beans that you can define in your own configuration to override those provided by the auto-configuration:

- A `CouchbaseTemplate` `@Bean` with a name of `couchbaseTemplate`.
- An `IndexManager` `@Bean` with a name of `couchbaseIndexManager`.
- A `CustomConversions` `@Bean` with a name of `couchbaseCustomConversions`.

To avoid hard-coding those names in your own config, you can reuse `BeanNames` provided by Spring Data Couchbase. For instance, you can customize the converters to use, as follows:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class SomeConfiguration {

    @Bean(BeanNames.COUCHBASE_CUSTOM_CONVERSIONS)
    public CustomConversions myCustomConversions() {
        return new CustomConversions(...);
    }

    // ...

}
```

|      | If you want to fully bypass the auto-configuration for Spring Data Couchbase, provide your own implementation of `org.springframework.data.couchbase.config.AbstractCouchbaseDataConfiguration`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.11.8. LDAP

[LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for any compliant LDAP server as well as support for the embedded in-memory LDAP server from [UnboundID](https://www.ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java).

LDAP abstractions are provided by [Spring Data LDAP](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-ldap). There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-ldap` “Starter” for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.

##### Connecting to an LDAP Server

To connect to an LDAP server, make sure you declare a dependency on the `spring-boot-starter-data-ldap` “Starter” or `spring-ldap-core` and then declare the URLs of your server in your application.properties, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.ldap.urls=ldap://myserver:1235
spring.ldap.username=admin
spring.ldap.password=secret
```

If you need to customize connection settings, you can use the `spring.ldap.base` and `spring.ldap.base-environment` properties.

An `LdapContextSource` is auto-configured based on these settings. If you need to customize it, for instance to use a `PooledContextSource`, you can still inject the auto-configured `LdapContextSource`. Make sure to flag your customized `ContextSource` as `@Primary` so that the auto-configured `LdapTemplate` uses it.

##### Spring Data LDAP Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for LDAP. For complete details of Spring Data LDAP, refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/ldap/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/).

You can also inject an auto-configured `LdapTemplate` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final LdapTemplate template;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(LdapTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }

    // ...

}
```

##### Embedded In-memory LDAP Server

For testing purposes, Spring Boot supports auto-configuration of an in-memory LDAP server from [UnboundID](https://ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java/). To configure the server, add a dependency to `com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk` and declare a `spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn` property, as follows:

```properties
spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn=dc=spring,dc=io
```

|      | It is possible to define multiple base-dn values, however, since distinguished names usually contain commas, they must be defined using the correct notation.In yaml files, you can use the yaml list notation:`spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn:  - dc=spring,dc=io  - dc=pivotal,dc=io`In properties files, you must include the index as part of the property name:`spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn[0]=dc=spring,dc=io spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn[1]=dc=pivotal,dc=io` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, the server starts on a random port and triggers the regular LDAP support. There is no need to specify a `spring.ldap.urls` property.

If there is a `schema.ldif` file on your classpath, it is used to initialize the server. If you want to load the initialization script from a different resource, you can also use the `spring.ldap.embedded.ldif` property.

By default, a standard schema is used to validate `LDIF` files. You can turn off validation altogether by setting the `spring.ldap.embedded.validation.enabled` property. If you have custom attributes, you can use `spring.ldap.embedded.validation.schema` to define your custom attribute types or object classes.

#### 4.11.9. InfluxDB

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is an open-source time series database optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet-of-Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

##### Connecting to InfluxDB

Spring Boot auto-configures an `InfluxDB` instance, provided the `influxdb-java` client is on the classpath and the URL of the database is set, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.influx.url=https://172.0.0.1:8086
```

If the connection to InfluxDB requires a user and password, you can set the `spring.influx.user` and `spring.influx.password` properties accordingly.

InfluxDB relies on OkHttp. If you need to tune the http client `InfluxDB` uses behind the scenes, you can register an `InfluxDbOkHttpClientBuilderProvider` bean.

### 4.12. Caching

The Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to an application. At its core, the abstraction applies caching to methods, thus reducing the number of executions based on the information available in the cache. The caching logic is applied transparently, without any interference to the invoker. Spring Boot auto-configures the cache infrastructure as long as caching support is enabled via the `@EnableCaching` annotation.

|      | Check the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache) of the Spring Framework reference for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

In a nutshell, to add caching to an operation of your service add the relevant annotation to its method, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MathService {

    @Cacheable("piDecimals")
    public int computePiDecimal(int i) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

This example demonstrates the use of caching on a potentially costly operation. Before invoking `computePiDecimal`, the abstraction looks for an entry in the `piDecimals` cache that matches the `i` argument. If an entry is found, the content in the cache is immediately returned to the caller, and the method is not invoked. Otherwise, the method is invoked, and the cache is updated before returning the value.

|      | You can also use the standard JSR-107 (JCache) annotations (such as `@CacheResult`) transparently. However, we strongly advise you to not mix and match the Spring Cache and JCache annotations. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you do not add any specific cache library, Spring Boot auto-configures a [simple provider](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-simple) that uses concurrent maps in memory. When a cache is required (such as `piDecimals` in the preceding example), this provider creates it for you. The simple provider is not really recommended for production usage, but it is great for getting started and making sure that you understand the features. When you have made up your mind about the cache provider to use, please make sure to read its documentation to figure out how to configure the caches that your application uses. Nearly all providers require you to explicitly configure every cache that you use in the application. Some offer a way to customize the default caches defined by the `spring.cache.cache-names` property.

|      | It is also possible to transparently [update](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache-annotations-put) or [evict](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache-annotations-evict) data from the cache. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.12.1. Supported Cache Providers

The cache abstraction does not provide an actual store and relies on abstraction materialized by the `org.springframework.cache.Cache` and `org.springframework.cache.CacheManager` interfaces.

If you have not defined a bean of type `CacheManager` or a `CacheResolver` named `cacheResolver` (see [`CachingConfigurer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/CachingConfigurer.html)), Spring Boot tries to detect the following providers (in the indicated order):

1. [Generic](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-generic)
2. [JCache (JSR-107)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-jcache) (EhCache 3, Hazelcast, Infinispan, and others)
3. [EhCache 2.x](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-ehcache2)
4. [Hazelcast](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-hazelcast)
5. [Infinispan](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-infinispan)
6. [Couchbase](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-couchbase)
7. [Redis](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-redis)
8. [Caffeine](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-caffeine)
9. [Simple](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-simple)

|      | It is also possible to *force* a particular cache provider by setting the `spring.cache.type` property. Use this property if you need to [disable caching altogether](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-none) in certain environment (such as tests). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Use the `spring-boot-starter-cache` “Starter” to quickly add basic caching dependencies. The starter brings in `spring-context-support`. If you add dependencies manually, you must include `spring-context-support` in order to use the JCache, EhCache 2.x, or Caffeine support. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If the `CacheManager` is auto-configured by Spring Boot, you can further tune its configuration before it is fully initialized by exposing a bean that implements the `CacheManagerCustomizer` interface. The following example sets a flag to say that `null` values should be passed down to the underlying map:

```java
@Bean
public CacheManagerCustomizer<ConcurrentMapCacheManager> cacheManagerCustomizer() {
    return new CacheManagerCustomizer<ConcurrentMapCacheManager>() {
        @Override
        public void customize(ConcurrentMapCacheManager cacheManager) {
            cacheManager.setAllowNullValues(false);
        }
    };
}
```

|      | In the preceding example, an auto-configured `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` is expected. If that is not the case (either you provided your own config or a different cache provider was auto-configured), the customizer is not invoked at all. You can have as many customizers as you want, and you can also order them by using `@Order` or `Ordered`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Generic

Generic caching is used if the context defines *at least* one `org.springframework.cache.Cache` bean. A `CacheManager` wrapping all beans of that type is created.

##### JCache (JSR-107)

[JCache](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) is bootstrapped through the presence of a `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider` on the classpath (that is, a JSR-107 compliant caching library exists on the classpath), and the `JCacheCacheManager` is provided by the `spring-boot-starter-cache` “Starter”. Various compliant libraries are available, and Spring Boot provides dependency management for Ehcache 3, Hazelcast, and Infinispan. Any other compliant library can be added as well.

It might happen that more than one provider is present, in which case the provider must be explicitly specified. Even if the JSR-107 standard does not enforce a standardized way to define the location of the configuration file, Spring Boot does its best to accommodate setting a cache with implementation details, as shown in the following example:

```properties
# Only necessary if more than one provider is present
spring.cache.jcache.provider=com.acme.MyCachingProvider
spring.cache.jcache.config=classpath:acme.xml
```

|      | When a cache library offers both a native implementation and JSR-107 support, Spring Boot prefers the JSR-107 support, so that the same features are available if you switch to a different JSR-107 implementation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Spring Boot has [general support for Hazelcast](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-hazelcast). If a single `HazelcastInstance` is available, it is automatically reused for the `CacheManager` as well, unless the `spring.cache.jcache.config` property is specified. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

There are two ways to customize the underlying `javax.cache.cacheManager`:

- Caches can be created on startup by setting the `spring.cache.cache-names` property. If a custom `javax.cache.configuration.Configuration` bean is defined, it is used to customize them.
- `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.JCacheManagerCustomizer` beans are invoked with the reference of the `CacheManager` for full customization.

|      | If a standard `javax.cache.CacheManager` bean is defined, it is wrapped automatically in an `org.springframework.cache.CacheManager` implementation that the abstraction expects. No further customization is applied to it. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### EhCache 2.x

[EhCache](https://www.ehcache.org/) 2.x is used if a file named `ehcache.xml` can be found at the root of the classpath. If EhCache 2.x is found, the `EhCacheCacheManager` provided by the `spring-boot-starter-cache` “Starter” is used to bootstrap the cache manager. An alternate configuration file can be provided as well, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.cache.ehcache.config=classpath:config/another-config.xml
```

##### Hazelcast

Spring Boot has [general support for Hazelcast](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-hazelcast). If a `HazelcastInstance` has been auto-configured, it is automatically wrapped in a `CacheManager`.

##### Infinispan

[Infinispan](https://infinispan.org/) has no default configuration file location, so it must be specified explicitly. Otherwise, the default bootstrap is used.

```properties
spring.cache.infinispan.config=infinispan.xml
```

Caches can be created on startup by setting the `spring.cache.cache-names` property. If a custom `ConfigurationBuilder` bean is defined, it is used to customize the caches.

|      | The support of Infinispan in Spring Boot is restricted to the embedded mode and is quite basic. If you want more options, you should use the official Infinispan Spring Boot starter instead. See [Infinispan’s documentation](https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Couchbase

If the [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) Java client and the `couchbase-spring-cache` implementation are available and Couchbase is [configured](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-couchbase), a `CouchbaseCacheManager` is auto-configured. It is also possible to create additional caches on startup by setting the `spring.cache.cache-names` property. These caches operate on the `Bucket` that was auto-configured. You can *also* create additional caches on another `Bucket` by using the customizer. Assume you need two caches (`cache1` and `cache2`) on the "main" `Bucket` and one (`cache3`) cache with a custom time to live of 2 seconds on the “another” `Bucket`. You can create the first two caches through configuration, as follows:

```properties
spring.cache.cache-names=cache1,cache2
```

Then you can define a `@Configuration` class to configure the extra `Bucket` and the `cache3` cache, as follows:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class CouchbaseCacheConfiguration {

    private final Cluster cluster;

    public CouchbaseCacheConfiguration(Cluster cluster) {
        this.cluster = cluster;
    }

    @Bean
    public Bucket anotherBucket() {
        return this.cluster.openBucket("another", "secret");
    }

    @Bean
    public CacheManagerCustomizer<CouchbaseCacheManager> cacheManagerCustomizer() {
        return c -> {
            c.prepareCache("cache3", CacheBuilder.newInstance(anotherBucket())
                    .withExpiration(2));
        };
    }

}
```

This sample configuration reuses the `Cluster` that was created through auto-configuration.

##### Redis

If [Redis](https://redis.io/) is available and configured, a `RedisCacheManager` is auto-configured. It is possible to create additional caches on startup by setting the `spring.cache.cache-names` property and cache defaults can be configured by using `spring.cache.redis.*` properties. For instance, the following configuration creates `cache1` and `cache2` caches with a *time to live* of 10 minutes:

```properties
spring.cache.cache-names=cache1,cache2
spring.cache.redis.time-to-live=600000
```

|      | By default, a key prefix is added so that, if two separate caches use the same key, Redis does not have overlapping keys and cannot return invalid values. We strongly recommend keeping this setting enabled if you create your own `RedisCacheManager`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | You can take full control of the default configuration by adding a `RedisCacheConfiguration` `@Bean` of your own. This can be useful if you’re looking for customizing the default serialization strategy. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering a `RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer` bean. The following example shows a customizer that configures a specific time to live for `cache1` and `cache2`:

```java
@Bean
public RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer myRedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer() {
    return (builder) -> builder
            .withCacheConfiguration("cache1",
                    RedisCacheConfiguration.defaultCacheConfig().entryTtl(Duration.ofSeconds(10)))
            .withCacheConfiguration("cache2",
                    RedisCacheConfiguration.defaultCacheConfig().entryTtl(Duration.ofMinutes(1)));

}
```

##### Caffeine

[Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) is a Java 8 rewrite of Guava’s cache that supersedes support for Guava. If Caffeine is present, a `CaffeineCacheManager` (provided by the `spring-boot-starter-cache` “Starter”) is auto-configured. Caches can be created on startup by setting the `spring.cache.cache-names` property and can be customized by one of the following (in the indicated order):

1. A cache spec defined by `spring.cache.caffeine.spec`
2. A `com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CaffeineSpec` bean is defined
3. A `com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Caffeine` bean is defined

For instance, the following configuration creates `cache1` and `cache2` caches with a maximum size of 500 and a *time to live* of 10 minutes

```properties
spring.cache.cache-names=cache1,cache2
spring.cache.caffeine.spec=maximumSize=500,expireAfterAccess=600s
```

If a `com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CacheLoader` bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the `CaffeineCacheManager`. Since the `CacheLoader` is going to be associated with *all* caches managed by the cache manager, it must be defined as `CacheLoader`. The auto-configuration ignores any other generic type.

##### Simple

If none of the other providers can be found, a simple implementation using a `ConcurrentHashMap` as the cache store is configured. This is the default if no caching library is present in your application. By default, caches are created as needed, but you can restrict the list of available caches by setting the `cache-names` property. For instance, if you want only `cache1` and `cache2` caches, set the `cache-names` property as follows:

```properties
spring.cache.cache-names=cache1,cache2
```

If you do so and your application uses a cache not listed, then it fails at runtime when the cache is needed, but not on startup. This is similar to the way the "real" cache providers behave if you use an undeclared cache.

##### None

When `@EnableCaching` is present in your configuration, a suitable cache configuration is expected as well. If you need to disable caching altogether in certain environments, force the cache type to `none` to use a no-op implementation, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.cache.type=none
```

### 4.13. Messaging

The Spring Framework provides extensive support for integrating with messaging systems, from simplified use of the JMS API using `JmsTemplate` to a complete infrastructure to receive messages asynchronously. Spring AMQP provides a similar feature set for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. Spring Boot also provides auto-configuration options for `RabbitTemplate` and RabbitMQ. Spring WebSocket natively includes support for STOMP messaging, and Spring Boot has support for that through starters and a small amount of auto-configuration. Spring Boot also has support for Apache Kafka.

#### 4.13.1. JMS

The `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` interface provides a standard method of creating a `javax.jms.Connection` for interacting with a JMS broker. Although Spring needs a `ConnectionFactory` to work with JMS, you generally need not use it directly yourself and can instead rely on higher level messaging abstractions. (See the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jms) of the Spring Framework reference documentation for details.) Spring Boot also auto-configures the necessary infrastructure to send and receive messages.

##### ActiveMQ Support

When [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) is available on the classpath, Spring Boot can also configure a `ConnectionFactory`. If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (provided no broker URL is specified through configuration).

|      | If you use `spring-boot-starter-activemq`, the necessary dependencies to connect or embed an ActiveMQ instance are provided, as is the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

ActiveMQ configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `spring.activemq.*`. For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.activemq.broker-url=tcp://192.168.1.210:9876
spring.activemq.user=admin
spring.activemq.password=secret
```

By default, a `CachingConnectionFactory` wraps the native `ConnectionFactory` with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in `spring.jms.*`:

```properties
spring.jms.cache.session-cache-size=5
```

If you’d rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency to `org.messaginghub:pooled-jms` and configuring the `JmsPoolConnectionFactory` accordingly, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.activemq.pool.enabled=true
spring.activemq.pool.max-connections=50
```

|      | See [`ActiveMQProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jms/activemq/ActiveMQProperties.java) for more of the supported options. You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `ActiveMQConnectionFactoryCustomizer` for more advanced customizations. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, ActiveMQ creates a destination if it does not yet exist so that destinations are resolved against their provided names.

##### Artemis Support

Spring Boot can auto-configure a `ConnectionFactory` when it detects that [Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/) is available on the classpath. If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (unless the mode property has been explicitly set). The supported modes are `embedded` (to make explicit that an embedded broker is required and that an error should occur if the broker is not available on the classpath) and `native` (to connect to a broker using the `netty` transport protocol). When the latter is configured, Spring Boot configures a `ConnectionFactory` that connects to a broker running on the local machine with the default settings.

|      | If you use `spring-boot-starter-artemis`, the necessary dependencies to connect to an existing Artemis instance are provided, as well as the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS. Adding `org.apache.activemq:artemis-jms-server` to your application lets you use embedded mode. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Artemis configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `spring.artemis.*`. For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.artemis.mode=native
spring.artemis.host=192.168.1.210
spring.artemis.port=9876
spring.artemis.user=admin
spring.artemis.password=secret
```

When embedding the broker, you can choose if you want to enable persistence and list the destinations that should be made available. These can be specified as a comma-separated list to create them with the default options, or you can define bean(s) of type `org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.server.config.JMSQueueConfiguration` or `org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.server.config.TopicConfiguration`, for advanced queue and topic configurations, respectively.

By default, a `CachingConnectionFactory` wraps the native `ConnectionFactory` with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in `spring.jms.*`:

```properties
spring.jms.cache.session-cache-size=5
```

If you’d rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency to `org.messaginghub:pooled-jms` and configuring the `JmsPoolConnectionFactory` accordingly, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.artemis.pool.enabled=true
spring.artemis.pool.max-connections=50
```

See [`ArtemisProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jms/artemis/ArtemisProperties.java) for more supported options.

No JNDI lookup is involved, and destinations are resolved against their names, using either the `name` attribute in the Artemis configuration or the names provided through configuration.

##### Using a JNDI ConnectionFactory

If you are running your application in an application server, Spring Boot tries to locate a JMS `ConnectionFactory` by using JNDI. By default, the `java:/JmsXA` and `java:/XAConnectionFactory` location are checked. You can use the `spring.jms.jndi-name` property if you need to specify an alternative location, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.jms.jndi-name=java:/MyConnectionFactory
```

##### Sending a Message

Spring’s `JmsTemplate` is auto-configured, and you can autowire it directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final JmsTemplate jmsTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(JmsTemplate jmsTemplate) {
        this.jmsTemplate = jmsTemplate;
    }

    // ...

}
```

|      | [`JmsMessagingTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsMessagingTemplate.html) can be injected in a similar manner. If a `DestinationResolver` or a `MessageConverter` bean is defined, it is associated automatically to the auto-configured `JmsTemplate`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Receiving a Message

When the JMS infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with `@JmsListener` to create a listener endpoint. If no `JmsListenerContainerFactory` has been defined, a default one is configured automatically. If a `DestinationResolver` or a `MessageConverter` beans is defined, it is associated automatically to the default factory.

By default, the default factory is transactional. If you run in an infrastructure where a `JtaTransactionManager` is present, it is associated to the listener container by default. If not, the `sessionTransacted` flag is enabled. In that latter scenario, you can associate your local data store transaction to the processing of an incoming message by adding `@Transactional` on your listener method (or a delegate thereof). This ensures that the incoming message is acknowledged, once the local transaction has completed. This also includes sending response messages that have been performed on the same JMS session.

The following component creates a listener endpoint on the `someQueue` destination:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @JmsListener(destination = "someQueue")
    public void processMessage(String content) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

|      | See [the Javadoc of `@EnableJms`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/EnableJms.html) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you need to create more `JmsListenerContainerFactory` instances or if you want to override the default, Spring Boot provides a `DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer` that you can use to initialize a `DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory` with the same settings as the one that is auto-configured.

For instance, the following example exposes another factory that uses a specific `MessageConverter`:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
static class JmsConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory myFactory(
            DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer) {
        DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory factory =
                new DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory();
        configurer.configure(factory, connectionFactory());
        factory.setMessageConverter(myMessageConverter());
        return factory;
    }

}
```

Then you can use the factory in any `@JmsListener`-annotated method as follows:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @JmsListener(destination = "someQueue", containerFactory="myFactory")
    public void processMessage(String content) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

#### 4.13.2. AMQP

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is a platform-neutral, wire-level protocol for message-oriented middleware. The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions. Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with AMQP through RabbitMQ, including the `spring-boot-starter-amqp` “Starter”.

##### RabbitMQ support

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a lightweight, reliable, scalable, and portable message broker based on the AMQP protocol. Spring uses `RabbitMQ` to communicate through the AMQP protocol.

RabbitMQ configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `spring.rabbitmq.*`. For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=admin
spring.rabbitmq.password=secret
```

Alternatively, you could configure the same connection using the `addresses` attribute:

```properties
spring.rabbitmq.addresses=amqp://admin:secret@localhost
```

If a `ConnectionNameStrategy` bean exists in the context, it will be automatically used to name connections created by the auto-configured `ConnectionFactory`. See [`RabbitProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/amqp/RabbitProperties.java) for more of the supported options.

|      | See [Understanding AMQP, the protocol used by RabbitMQ](https://spring.io/blog/2010/06/14/understanding-amqp-the-protocol-used-by-rabbitmq/) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Sending a Message

Spring’s `AmqpTemplate` and `AmqpAdmin` are auto-configured, and you can autowire them directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.amqp.core.AmqpAdmin;
import org.springframework.amqp.core.AmqpTemplate;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final AmqpAdmin amqpAdmin;
    private final AmqpTemplate amqpTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(AmqpAdmin amqpAdmin, AmqpTemplate amqpTemplate) {
        this.amqpAdmin = amqpAdmin;
        this.amqpTemplate = amqpTemplate;
    }

    // ...

}
```

|      | [`RabbitMessagingTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/amqp/rabbit/core/RabbitMessagingTemplate.html) can be injected in a similar manner. If a `MessageConverter` bean is defined, it is associated automatically to the auto-configured `AmqpTemplate`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If necessary, any `org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue` that is defined as a bean is automatically used to declare a corresponding queue on the RabbitMQ instance.

To retry operations, you can enable retries on the `AmqpTemplate` (for example, in the event that the broker connection is lost):

```properties
spring.rabbitmq.template.retry.enabled=true
spring.rabbitmq.template.retry.initial-interval=2s
```

Retries are disabled by default. You can also customize the `RetryTemplate` programmatically by declaring a `RabbitRetryTemplateCustomizer` bean.

##### Receiving a Message

When the Rabbit infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with `@RabbitListener` to create a listener endpoint. If no `RabbitListenerContainerFactory` has been defined, a default `SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory` is automatically configured and you can switch to a direct container using the `spring.rabbitmq.listener.type` property. If a `MessageConverter` or a `MessageRecoverer` bean is defined, it is automatically associated with the default factory.

The following sample component creates a listener endpoint on the `someQueue` queue:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @RabbitListener(queues = "someQueue")
    public void processMessage(String content) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

|      | See [the Javadoc of `@EnableRabbit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/amqp/rabbit/annotation/EnableRabbit.html) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you need to create more `RabbitListenerContainerFactory` instances or if you want to override the default, Spring Boot provides a `SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer` and a `DirectRabbitListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer` that you can use to initialize a `SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory` and a `DirectRabbitListenerContainerFactory` with the same settings as the factories used by the auto-configuration.

|      | It does not matter which container type you chose. Those two beans are exposed by the auto-configuration. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

For instance, the following configuration class exposes another factory that uses a specific `MessageConverter`:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
static class RabbitConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory myFactory(
            SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer) {
        SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory factory =
                new SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory();
        configurer.configure(factory, connectionFactory);
        factory.setMessageConverter(myMessageConverter());
        return factory;
    }

}
```

Then you can use the factory in any `@RabbitListener`-annotated method, as follows:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @RabbitListener(queues = "someQueue", containerFactory="myFactory")
    public void processMessage(String content) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

You can enable retries to handle situations where your listener throws an exception. By default, `RejectAndDontRequeueRecoverer` is used, but you can define a `MessageRecoverer` of your own. When retries are exhausted, the message is rejected and either dropped or routed to a dead-letter exchange if the broker is configured to do so. By default, retries are disabled. You can also customize the `RetryTemplate` programmatically by declaring a `RabbitRetryTemplateCustomizer` bean.

|      | By default, if retries are disabled and the listener throws an exception, the delivery is retried indefinitely. You can modify this behavior in two ways: Set the `defaultRequeueRejected` property to `false` so that zero re-deliveries are attempted or throw an `AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException` to signal the message should be rejected. The latter is the mechanism used when retries are enabled and the maximum number of delivery attempts is reached. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.13.3. Apache Kafka Support

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is supported by providing auto-configuration of the `spring-kafka` project.

Kafka configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `spring.kafka.*`. For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=myGroup
```

|      | To create a topic on startup, add a bean of type `NewTopic`. If the topic already exists, the bean is ignored. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

See [`KafkaProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/kafka/KafkaProperties.java) for more supported options.

##### Sending a Message

Spring’s `KafkaTemplate` is auto-configured, and you can autowire it directly in your own beans, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    private final KafkaTemplate kafkaTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(KafkaTemplate kafkaTemplate) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
    }

    // ...

}
```

|      | If the property `spring.kafka.producer.transaction-id-prefix` is defined, a `KafkaTransactionManager` is automatically configured. Also, if a `RecordMessageConverter` bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the auto-configured `KafkaTemplate`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Receiving a Message

When the Apache Kafka infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with `@KafkaListener` to create a listener endpoint. If no `KafkaListenerContainerFactory` has been defined, a default one is automatically configured with keys defined in `spring.kafka.listener.*`.

The following component creates a listener endpoint on the `someTopic` topic:

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "someTopic")
    public void processMessage(String content) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

If a `KafkaTransactionManager` bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the container factory. Similarly, if a `ErrorHandler`, `AfterRollbackProcessor` or `ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener` bean is defined, it is automatically associated to the default factory.

Depending on the listener type, a `RecordMessageConverter` or `BatchMessageConverter` bean is associated to the default factory. If only a `RecordMessageConverter` bean is present for a batch listener, it is wrapped in a `BatchMessageConverter`.

|      | A custom `ChainedKafkaTransactionManager` must be marked `@Primary` as it usually references the auto-configured `KafkaTransactionManager` bean. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Kafka Streams

Spring for Apache Kafka provides a factory bean to create a `StreamsBuilder` object and manage the lifecycle of its streams. Spring Boot auto-configures the required `KafkaStreamsConfiguration` bean as long as `kafka-streams` is on the classpath and Kafka Streams is enabled via the `@EnableKafkaStreams` annotation.

Enabling Kafka Streams means that the application id and bootstrap servers must be set. The former can be configured using `spring.kafka.streams.application-id`, defaulting to `spring.application.name` if not set. The latter can be set globally or specifically overridden only for streams.

Several additional properties are available using dedicated properties; other arbitrary Kafka properties can be set using the `spring.kafka.streams.properties` namespace. See also [Additional Kafka Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-kafka-extra-props) for more information.

To use the factory bean, wire `StreamsBuilder` into your `@Bean` as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableKafkaStreams
public static class KafkaStreamsExampleConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public KStream<Integer, String> kStream(StreamsBuilder streamsBuilder) {
        KStream<Integer, String> stream = streamsBuilder.stream("ks1In");
        stream.map((k, v) -> new KeyValue<>(k, v.toUpperCase())).to("ks1Out",
                Produced.with(Serdes.Integer(), new JsonSerde<>()));
        return stream;
    }

}
```

By default, the streams managed by the `StreamBuilder` object it creates are started automatically. You can customize this behaviour using the `spring.kafka.streams.auto-startup` property.

##### Additional Kafka Properties

The properties supported by auto configuration are shown in [Common Application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties). Note that, for the most part, these properties (hyphenated or camelCase) map directly to the Apache Kafka dotted properties. Refer to the Apache Kafka documentation for details.

The first few of these properties apply to all components (producers, consumers, admins, and streams) but can be specified at the component level if you wish to use different values. Apache Kafka designates properties with an importance of HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. Spring Boot auto-configuration supports all HIGH importance properties, some selected MEDIUM and LOW properties, and any properties that do not have a default value.

Only a subset of the properties supported by Kafka are available directly through the `KafkaProperties` class. If you wish to configure the producer or consumer with additional properties that are not directly supported, use the following properties:

```properties
spring.kafka.properties.prop.one=first
spring.kafka.admin.properties.prop.two=second
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.prop.three=third
spring.kafka.producer.properties.prop.four=fourth
spring.kafka.streams.properties.prop.five=fifth
```

This sets the common `prop.one` Kafka property to `first` (applies to producers, consumers and admins), the `prop.two` admin property to `second`, the `prop.three` consumer property to `third`, the `prop.four` producer property to `fourth` and the `prop.five` streams property to `fifth`.

You can also configure the Spring Kafka `JsonDeserializer` as follows:

```properties
spring.kafka.consumer.value-deserializer=org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonDeserializer
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.spring.json.value.default.type=com.example.Invoice
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.spring.json.trusted.packages=com.example,org.acme
```

Similarly, you can disable the `JsonSerializer` default behavior of sending type information in headers:

```properties
spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer=org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.properties.spring.json.add.type.headers=false
```

|      | Properties set in this way override any configuration item that Spring Boot explicitly supports. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Testing with Embedded Kafka

Spring for Apache Kafka provides a convenient way to test projects with an embedded Apache Kafka broker. To use this feature, annotate a test class with `@EmbeddedKafka` from the `spring-kafka-test` module. For more information, please see the Spring for Apache Kafka [reference manual](https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/current/reference/html/#embedded-kafka-annotation).

To make Spring Boot auto-configuration work with the aforementioned embedded Apache Kafka broker, you need to remap a system property for embedded broker addresses (populated by the `EmbeddedKafkaBroker`) into the Spring Boot configuration property for Apache Kafka. There are several ways to do that:

- Provide a system property to map embedded broker addresses into `spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers` in the test class:

```java
static {
    System.setProperty(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.BROKER_LIST_PROPERTY, "spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers");
}
```

- Configure a property name on the `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation:

```java
@EmbeddedKafka(topics = "someTopic",
        bootstrapServersProperty = "spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers")
```

- Use a placeholder in configuration properties:

```properties
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
```

### 4.14. Calling REST Services with `RestTemplate`

If you need to call remote REST services from your application, you can use the Spring Framework’s [`RestTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html) class. Since `RestTemplate` instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured `RestTemplate` bean. It does, however, auto-configure a `RestTemplateBuilder`, which can be used to create `RestTemplate` instances when needed. The auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` ensures that sensible `HttpMessageConverters` are applied to `RestTemplate` instances.

The following code shows a typical example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public MyService(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
        this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
    }

    public Details someRestCall(String name) {
        return this.restTemplate.getForObject("/{name}/details", Details.class, name);
    }

}
```

|      | `RestTemplateBuilder` includes a number of useful methods that can be used to quickly configure a `RestTemplate`. For example, to add BASIC auth support, you can use `builder.basicAuthentication("user", "password").build()`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.14.1. RestTemplate Customization

There are three main approaches to `RestTemplate` customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` and then call its methods as required. Each method call returns a new `RestTemplateBuilder` instance, so the customizations only affect this use of the builder.

To make an application-wide, additive customization, use a `RestTemplateCustomizer` bean. All such beans are automatically registered with the auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` and are applied to any templates that are built with it.

The following example shows a customizer that configures the use of a proxy for all hosts except `192.168.0.5`:

```java
static class ProxyCustomizer implements RestTemplateCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
        HttpHost proxy = new HttpHost("proxy.example.com");
        HttpClient httpClient = HttpClientBuilder.create().setRoutePlanner(new DefaultProxyRoutePlanner(proxy) {

            @Override
            public HttpHost determineProxy(HttpHost target, HttpRequest request, HttpContext context)
                    throws HttpException {
                if (target.getHostName().equals("192.168.0.5")) {
                    return null;
                }
                return super.determineProxy(target, request, context);
            }

        }).build();
        restTemplate.setRequestFactory(new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory(httpClient));
    }

}
```

Finally, the most extreme (and rarely used) option is to create your own `RestTemplateBuilder` bean. Doing so switches off the auto-configuration of a `RestTemplateBuilder` and prevents any `RestTemplateCustomizer` beans from being used.

### 4.15. Calling REST Services with `WebClient`

If you have Spring WebFlux on your classpath, you can also choose to use `WebClient` to call remote REST services. Compared to `RestTemplate`, this client has a more functional feel and is fully reactive. You can learn more about the `WebClient` in the dedicated [section in the Spring Framework docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-client).

Spring Boot creates and pre-configures a `WebClient.Builder` for you; it is strongly advised to inject it in your components and use it to create `WebClient` instances. Spring Boot is configuring that builder to share HTTP resources, reflect codecs setup in the same fashion as the server ones (see [WebFlux HTTP codecs auto-configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-webflux-httpcodecs)), and more.

The following code shows a typical example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final WebClient webClient;

    public MyService(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder) {
        this.webClient = webClientBuilder.baseUrl("https://example.org").build();
    }

    public Mono<Details> someRestCall(String name) {
        return this.webClient.get().uri("/{name}/details", name)
                        .retrieve().bodyToMono(Details.class);
    }

}
```

#### 4.15.1. WebClient Runtime

Spring Boot will auto-detect which `ClientHttpConnector` to use to drive `WebClient`, depending on the libraries available on the application classpath. For now, Reactor Netty and Jetty RS client are supported.

The `spring-boot-starter-webflux` starter depends on `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty` by default, which brings both server and client implementations. If you choose to use Jetty as a reactive server instead, you should add a dependency on the Jetty Reactive HTTP client library, `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-reactive-httpclient`. Using the same technology for server and client has it advantages, as it will automatically share HTTP resources between client and server.

Developers can override the resource configuration for Jetty and Reactor Netty by providing a custom `ReactorResourceFactory` or `JettyResourceFactory` bean - this will be applied to both clients and servers.

If you wish to override that choice for the client, you can define your own `ClientHttpConnector` bean and have full control over the client configuration.

You can learn more about the [`WebClient` configuration options in the Spring Framework reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-client-builder).

#### 4.15.2. WebClient Customization

There are three main approaches to `WebClient` customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured `WebClient.Builder` and then call its methods as required. `WebClient.Builder` instances are stateful: Any change on the builder is reflected in all clients subsequently created with it. If you want to create several clients with the same builder, you can also consider cloning the builder with `WebClient.Builder other = builder.clone();`.

To make an application-wide, additive customization to all `WebClient.Builder` instances, you can declare `WebClientCustomizer` beans and change the `WebClient.Builder` locally at the point of injection.

Finally, you can fall back to the original API and use `WebClient.create()`. In that case, no auto-configuration or `WebClientCustomizer` is applied.

### 4.16. Validation

The method validation feature supported by Bean Validation 1.1 is automatically enabled as long as a JSR-303 implementation (such as Hibernate validator) is on the classpath. This lets bean methods be annotated with `javax.validation` constraints on their parameters and/or on their return value. Target classes with such annotated methods need to be annotated with the `@Validated` annotation at the type level for their methods to be searched for inline constraint annotations.

For instance, the following service triggers the validation of the first argument, making sure its size is between 8 and 10:

```java
@Service
@Validated
public class MyBean {

    public Archive findByCodeAndAuthor(@Size(min = 8, max = 10) String code,
            Author author) {
        ...
    }

}
```

### 4.17. Sending Email

The Spring Framework provides an abstraction for sending email by using the `JavaMailSender` interface, and Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for it as well as a starter module.

|      | See the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#mail) for a detailed explanation of how you can use `JavaMailSender`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If `spring.mail.host` and the relevant libraries (as defined by `spring-boot-starter-mail`) are available, a default `JavaMailSender` is created if none exists. The sender can be further customized by configuration items from the `spring.mail` namespace. See [`MailProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/mail/MailProperties.java) for more details.

In particular, certain default timeout values are infinite, and you may want to change that to avoid having a thread blocked by an unresponsive mail server, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.connectiontimeout=5000
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.timeout=3000
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.writetimeout=5000
```

It is also possible to configure a `JavaMailSender` with an existing `Session` from JNDI:

```properties
spring.mail.jndi-name=mail/Session
```

When a `jndi-name` is set, it takes precedence over all other Session-related settings.

### 4.18. Distributed Transactions with JTA

Spring Boot supports distributed JTA transactions across multiple XA resources by using either an [Atomikos](https://www.atomikos.com/) or [Bitronix](https://github.com/bitronix/btm) embedded transaction manager. JTA transactions are also supported when deploying to a suitable Java EE Application Server.

When a JTA environment is detected, Spring’s `JtaTransactionManager` is used to manage transactions. Auto-configured JMS, DataSource, and JPA beans are upgraded to support XA transactions. You can use standard Spring idioms, such as `@Transactional`, to participate in a distributed transaction. If you are within a JTA environment and still want to use local transactions, you can set the `spring.jta.enabled` property to `false` to disable the JTA auto-configuration.

#### 4.18.1. Using an Atomikos Transaction Manager

[Atomikos](https://www.atomikos.com/) is a popular open source transaction manager which can be embedded into your Spring Boot application. You can use the `spring-boot-starter-jta-atomikos` starter to pull in the appropriate Atomikos libraries. Spring Boot auto-configures Atomikos and ensures that appropriate `depends-on` settings are applied to your Spring beans for correct startup and shutdown ordering.

By default, Atomikos transaction logs are written to a `transaction-logs` directory in your application’s home directory (the directory in which your application jar file resides). You can customize the location of this directory by setting a `spring.jta.log-dir` property in your `application.properties` file. Properties starting with `spring.jta.atomikos.properties` can also be used to customize the Atomikos `UserTransactionServiceImp`. See the [`AtomikosProperties` Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/jta/atomikos/AtomikosProperties.html) for complete details.

|      | To ensure that multiple transaction managers can safely coordinate the same resource managers, each Atomikos instance must be configured with a unique ID. By default, this ID is the IP address of the machine on which Atomikos is running. To ensure uniqueness in production, you should configure the `spring.jta.transaction-manager-id` property with a different value for each instance of your application. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.18.2. Using a Bitronix Transaction Manager

[Bitronix](https://github.com/bitronix/btm) is a popular open-source JTA transaction manager implementation. You can use the `spring-boot-starter-jta-bitronix` starter to add the appropriate Bitronix dependencies to your project. As with Atomikos, Spring Boot automatically configures Bitronix and post-processes your beans to ensure that startup and shutdown ordering is correct.

By default, Bitronix transaction log files (`part1.btm` and `part2.btm`) are written to a `transaction-logs` directory in your application home directory. You can customize the location of this directory by setting the `spring.jta.log-dir` property. Properties starting with `spring.jta.bitronix.properties` are also bound to the `bitronix.tm.Configuration` bean, allowing for complete customization. See the [Bitronix documentation](https://github.com/bitronix/btm/wiki/Transaction-manager-configuration) for details.

|      | To ensure that multiple transaction managers can safely coordinate the same resource managers, each Bitronix instance must be configured with a unique ID. By default, this ID is the IP address of the machine on which Bitronix is running. To ensure uniqueness in production, you should configure the `spring.jta.transaction-manager-id` property with a different value for each instance of your application. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.18.3. Using a Java EE Managed Transaction Manager

If you package your Spring Boot application as a `war` or `ear` file and deploy it to a Java EE application server, you can use your application server’s built-in transaction manager. Spring Boot tries to auto-configure a transaction manager by looking at common JNDI locations (`java:comp/UserTransaction`, `java:comp/TransactionManager`, and so on). If you use a transaction service provided by your application server, you generally also want to ensure that all resources are managed by the server and exposed over JNDI. Spring Boot tries to auto-configure JMS by looking for a `ConnectionFactory` at the JNDI path (`java:/JmsXA` or `java:/XAConnectionFactory`), and you can use the [`spring.datasource.jndi-name` property](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-connecting-to-a-jndi-datasource) to configure your `DataSource`.

#### 4.18.4. Mixing XA and Non-XA JMS Connections

When using JTA, the primary JMS `ConnectionFactory` bean is XA-aware and participates in distributed transactions. In some situations, you might want to process certain JMS messages by using a non-XA `ConnectionFactory`. For example, your JMS processing logic might take longer than the XA timeout.

If you want to use a non-XA `ConnectionFactory`, you can inject the `nonXaJmsConnectionFactory` bean rather than the `@Primary` `jmsConnectionFactory` bean. For consistency, the `jmsConnectionFactory` bean is also provided by using the bean alias `xaJmsConnectionFactory`.

The following example shows how to inject `ConnectionFactory` instances:

```java
// Inject the primary (XA aware) ConnectionFactory
@Autowired
private ConnectionFactory defaultConnectionFactory;

// Inject the XA aware ConnectionFactory (uses the alias and injects the same as above)
@Autowired
@Qualifier("xaJmsConnectionFactory")
private ConnectionFactory xaConnectionFactory;

// Inject the non-XA aware ConnectionFactory
@Autowired
@Qualifier("nonXaJmsConnectionFactory")
private ConnectionFactory nonXaConnectionFactory;
```

#### 4.18.5. Supporting an Alternative Embedded Transaction Manager

The [`XAConnectionFactoryWrapper`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jms/XAConnectionFactoryWrapper.java) and [`XADataSourceWrapper`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jdbc/XADataSourceWrapper.java) interfaces can be used to support alternative embedded transaction managers. The interfaces are responsible for wrapping `XAConnectionFactory` and `XADataSource` beans and exposing them as regular `ConnectionFactory` and `DataSource` beans, which transparently enroll in the distributed transaction. DataSource and JMS auto-configuration use JTA variants, provided you have a `JtaTransactionManager` bean and appropriate XA wrapper beans registered within your `ApplicationContext`.

The [BitronixXAConnectionFactoryWrapper](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jta/bitronix/BitronixXAConnectionFactoryWrapper.java) and [BitronixXADataSourceWrapper](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jta/bitronix/BitronixXADataSourceWrapper.java) provide good examples of how to write XA wrappers.

### 4.19. Hazelcast

If [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot auto-configures a `HazelcastInstance` that you can inject in your application.

If you define a `com.hazelcast.config.Config` bean, Spring Boot uses that. If your configuration defines an instance name, Spring Boot tries to locate an existing instance rather than creating a new one.

You could also specify the Hazelcast configuration file to use through configuration, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.hazelcast.config=classpath:config/my-hazelcast.xml
```

Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to find the Hazelcast configuration from the default locations: `hazelcast.xml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath, or a `.yaml` counterpart in the same locations. We also check if the `hazelcast.config` system property is set. See the [Hazelcast documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/) for more details.

If `hazelcast-client` is present on the classpath, Spring Boot first attempts to create a client by checking the following configuration options:

- The presence of a `com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig` bean.
- A configuration file defined by the `spring.hazelcast.config` property.
- The presence of the `hazelcast.client.config` system property.
- A `hazelcast-client.xml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.
- A `hazelcast-client.yaml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.

|      | Spring Boot also has [explicit caching support for Hazelcast](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-caching-provider-hazelcast). If caching is enabled, the `HazelcastInstance` is automatically wrapped in a `CacheManager` implementation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 4.20. Quartz Scheduler

Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with the [Quartz scheduler](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/), including the `spring-boot-starter-quartz` “Starter”. If Quartz is available, a `Scheduler` is auto-configured (through the `SchedulerFactoryBean` abstraction).

Beans of the following types are automatically picked up and associated with the `Scheduler`:

- `JobDetail`: defines a particular Job. `JobDetail` instances can be built with the `JobBuilder` API.
- `Calendar`.
- `Trigger`: defines when a particular job is triggered.

By default, an in-memory `JobStore` is used. However, it is possible to configure a JDBC-based store if a `DataSource` bean is available in your application and if the `spring.quartz.job-store-type` property is configured accordingly, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.quartz.job-store-type=jdbc
```

When the JDBC store is used, the schema can be initialized on startup, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.quartz.jdbc.initialize-schema=always
```

|      | By default, the database is detected and initialized by using the standard scripts provided with the Quartz library. These scripts drop existing tables, deleting all triggers on every restart. It is also possible to provide a custom script by setting the `spring.quartz.jdbc.schema` property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To have Quartz use a `DataSource` other than the application’s main `DataSource`, declare a `DataSource` bean, annotating its `@Bean` method with `@QuartzDataSource`. Doing so ensures that the Quartz-specific `DataSource` is used by both the `SchedulerFactoryBean` and for schema initialization.

By default, jobs created by configuration will not overwrite already registered jobs that have been read from a persistent job store. To enable overwriting existing job definitions set the `spring.quartz.overwrite-existing-jobs` property.

Quartz Scheduler configuration can be customized using `spring.quartz` properties and `SchedulerFactoryBeanCustomizer` beans, which allow programmatic `SchedulerFactoryBean` customization. Advanced Quartz configuration properties can be customized using `spring.quartz.properties.*`.

|      | In particular, an `Executor` bean is not associated with the scheduler as Quartz offers a way to configure the scheduler via `spring.quartz.properties`. If you need to customize the task executor, consider implementing `SchedulerFactoryBeanCustomizer`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Jobs can define setters to inject data map properties. Regular beans can also be injected in a similar manner, as shown in the following example:

```java
public class SampleJob extends QuartzJobBean {

    private MyService myService;

    private String name;

    // Inject "MyService" bean
    public void setMyService(MyService myService) { ... }

    // Inject the "name" job data property
    public void setName(String name) { ... }

    @Override
    protected void executeInternal(JobExecutionContext context)
            throws JobExecutionException {
        ...
    }

}
```

### 4.21. Task Execution and Scheduling

In the absence of an `Executor` bean in the context, Spring Boot auto-configures a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` with sensible defaults that can be automatically associated to asynchronous task execution (`@EnableAsync`) and Spring MVC asynchronous request processing.

|      | If you have defined a custom `Executor` in the context, regular task execution (i.e. `@EnableAsync`) will use it transparently but the Spring MVC support will not be configured as it requires an `AsyncTaskExecutor` implementation (named `applicationTaskExecutor`). Depending on your target arrangement, you could change your `Executor` into a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` or define both a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` and an `AsyncConfigurer` wrapping your custom `Executor`.The auto-configured `TaskExecutorBuilder` allows you to easily create instances that reproduce what the auto-configuration does by default. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The thread pool uses 8 core threads that can grow and shrink according to the load. Those default settings can be fine-tuned using the `spring.task.execution` namespace as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.task.execution.pool.max-size=16
spring.task.execution.pool.queue-capacity=100
spring.task.execution.pool.keep-alive=10s
```

This changes the thread pool to use a bounded queue so that when the queue is full (100 tasks), the thread pool increases to maximum 16 threads. Shrinking of the pool is more aggressive as threads are reclaimed when they are idle for 10 seconds (rather than 60 seconds by default).

A `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` can also be auto-configured if need to be associated to scheduled task execution (`@EnableScheduling`). The thread pool uses one thread by default and those settings can be fine-tuned using the `spring.task.scheduling` namespace.

Both a `TaskExecutorBuilder` bean and a `TaskSchedulerBuilder` bean are made available in the context if a custom executor or scheduler needs to be created.

### 4.22. Spring Integration

Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with [Spring Integration](https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration), including the `spring-boot-starter-integration` “Starter”. Spring Integration provides abstractions over messaging and also other transports such as HTTP, TCP, and others. If Spring Integration is available on your classpath, it is initialized through the `@EnableIntegration` annotation.

Spring Boot also configures some features that are triggered by the presence of additional Spring Integration modules. If `spring-integration-jmx` is also on the classpath, message processing statistics are published over JMX. If `spring-integration-jdbc` is available, the default database schema can be created on startup, as shown in the following line:

```properties
spring.integration.jdbc.initialize-schema=always
```

See the [`IntegrationAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/integration/IntegrationAutoConfiguration.java) and [`IntegrationProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/integration/IntegrationProperties.java) classes for more details.

By default, if a Micrometer `meterRegistry` bean is present, Spring Integration metrics will be managed by Micrometer. If you wish to use legacy Spring Integration metrics, add a `DefaultMetricsFactory` bean to the application context.

### 4.23. Spring Session

Spring Boot provides [Spring Session](https://spring.io/projects/spring-session) auto-configuration for a wide range of data stores. When building a Servlet web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

- JDBC
- Redis
- Hazelcast
- MongoDB

When building a reactive web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

- Redis
- MongoDB

If a single Spring Session module is present on the classpath, Spring Boot uses that store implementation automatically. If you have more than one implementation, you must choose the [`StoreType`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/session/StoreType.java) that you wish to use to store the sessions. For instance, to use JDBC as the back-end store, you can configure your application as follows:

```properties
spring.session.store-type=jdbc
```

|      | You can disable Spring Session by setting the `store-type` to `none`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Each store has specific additional settings. For instance, it is possible to customize the name of the table for the JDBC store, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.session.jdbc.table-name=SESSIONS
```

For setting the timeout of the session you can use the `spring.session.timeout` property. If that property is not set, the auto-configuration falls back to the value of `server.servlet.session.timeout`.

### 4.24. Monitoring and Management over JMX

Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage applications. Spring Boot exposes the most suitable `MBeanServer` as a bean with an ID of `mbeanServer`. Any of your beans that are annotated with Spring JMX annotations (`@ManagedResource`, `@ManagedAttribute`, or `@ManagedOperation`) are exposed to it.

If your platform provides a standard `MBeanServer`, Spring Boot will use that and default to the VM `MBeanServer` if necessary. If all that fails, a new `MBeanServer` will be created.

See the [`JmxAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jmx/JmxAutoConfiguration.java) class for more details.

### 4.25. Testing

Spring Boot provides a number of utilities and annotations to help when testing your application. Test support is provided by two modules: `spring-boot-test` contains core items, and `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` supports auto-configuration for tests.

Most developers use the `spring-boot-starter-test` “Starter”, which imports both Spring Boot test modules as well as JUnit Jupiter, AssertJ, Hamcrest, and a number of other useful libraries.

|      | The starter also brings the vintage engine so that you can run both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 tests. If you have migrated your tests to JUnit 5, you should exclude JUnit 4 support, as shown in the following example:`    org.springframework.boot    spring-boot-starter-test    test                        org.junit.vintage            junit-vintage-engine             ` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.25.1. Test Scope Dependencies

The `spring-boot-starter-test` “Starter” (in the `test` `scope`) contains the following provided libraries:

- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) (including the vintage engine for backward compatibility with JUnit 4): The de-facto standard for unit testing Java applications.
- [Spring Test](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#integration-testing) & Spring Boot Test: Utilities and integration test support for Spring Boot applications.
- [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/): A fluent assertion library.
- [Hamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest): A library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates).
- [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/): A Java mocking framework.
- [JSONassert](https://github.com/skyscreamer/JSONassert): An assertion library for JSON.
- [JsonPath](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath): XPath for JSON.

We generally find these common libraries to be useful when writing tests. If these libraries do not suit your needs, you can add additional test dependencies of your own.

#### 4.25.2. Testing Spring Applications

One of the major advantages of dependency injection is that it should make your code easier to unit test. You can instantiate objects by using the `new` operator without even involving Spring. You can also use *mock objects* instead of real dependencies.

Often, you need to move beyond unit testing and start integration testing (with a Spring `ApplicationContext`). It is useful to be able to perform integration testing without requiring deployment of your application or needing to connect to other infrastructure.

The Spring Framework includes a dedicated test module for such integration testing. You can declare a dependency directly to `org.springframework:spring-test` or use the `spring-boot-starter-test` “Starter” to pull it in transitively.

If you have not used the `spring-test` module before, you should start by reading the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#testing) of the Spring Framework reference documentation.

#### 4.25.3. Testing Spring Boot Applications

A Spring Boot application is a Spring `ApplicationContext`, so nothing very special has to be done to test it beyond what you would normally do with a vanilla Spring context.

|      | External properties, logging, and other features of Spring Boot are installed in the context by default only if you use `SpringApplication` to create it. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot provides a `@SpringBootTest` annotation, which can be used as an alternative to the standard `spring-test` `@ContextConfiguration` annotation when you need Spring Boot features. The annotation works by [creating the `ApplicationContext` used in your tests through `SpringApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-detecting-config). In addition to `@SpringBootTest` a number of other annotations are also provided for [testing more specific slices](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-tests) of an application.

|      | If you are using JUnit 4, don’t forget to also add `@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)` to your test, otherwise the annotations will be ignored. If you are using JUnit 5, there’s no need to add the equivalent `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)` as `@SpringBootTest` and the other `@…Test` annotations are already annotated with it. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, `@SpringBootTest` will not start a server. You can use the `webEnvironment` attribute of `@SpringBootTest` to further refine how your tests run:

- `MOCK`(Default) : Loads a web `ApplicationContext` and provides a mock web environment. Embedded servers are not started when using this annotation. If a web environment is not available on your classpath, this mode transparently falls back to creating a regular non-web `ApplicationContext`. It can be used in conjunction with [`@AutoConfigureMockMvc` or `@AutoConfigureWebTestClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-with-mock-environment) for mock-based testing of your web application.
- `RANDOM_PORT`: Loads a `WebServerApplicationContext` and provides a real web environment. Embedded servers are started and listen on a random port.
- `DEFINED_PORT`: Loads a `WebServerApplicationContext` and provides a real web environment. Embedded servers are started and listen on a defined port (from your `application.properties`) or on the default port of `8080`.
- `NONE`: Loads an `ApplicationContext` by using `SpringApplication` but does not provide *any* web environment (mock or otherwise).

|      | If your test is `@Transactional`, it rolls back the transaction at the end of each test method by default. However, as using this arrangement with either `RANDOM_PORT` or `DEFINED_PORT` implicitly provides a real servlet environment, the HTTP client and server run in separate threads and, thus, in separate transactions. Any transaction initiated on the server does not roll back in this case. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | `@SpringBootTest` with `webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT` will also start the management server on a separate random port if your application uses a different port for the management server. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Detecting Web Application Type

If Spring MVC is available, a regular MVC-based application context is configured. If you have only Spring WebFlux, we’ll detect that and configure a WebFlux-based application context instead.

If both are present, Spring MVC takes precedence. If you want to test a reactive web application in this scenario, you must set the `spring.main.web-application-type` property:

```java
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.main.web-application-type=reactive")
class MyWebFluxTests { ... }
```

##### Detecting Test Configuration

If you are familiar with the Spring Test Framework, you may be used to using `@ContextConfiguration(classes=…)` in order to specify which Spring `@Configuration` to load. Alternatively, you might have often used nested `@Configuration` classes within your test.

When testing Spring Boot applications, this is often not required. Spring Boot’s `@*Test` annotations search for your primary configuration automatically whenever you do not explicitly define one.

The search algorithm works up from the package that contains the test until it finds a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` or `@SpringBootConfiguration`. As long as you [structured your code](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-structuring-your-code) in a sensible way, your main configuration is usually found.

|      | If you use a [test annotation to test a more specific slice of your application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-tests), you should avoid adding configuration settings that are specific to a particular area on the [main method’s application class](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-user-configuration).The underlying component scan configuration of `@SpringBootApplication` defines exclude filters that are used to make sure slicing works as expected. If you are using an explicit `@ComponentScan` directive on your `@SpringBootApplication`-annotated class, be aware that those filters will be disabled. If you are using slicing, you should define them again. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you want to customize the primary configuration, you can use a nested `@TestConfiguration` class. Unlike a nested `@Configuration` class, which would be used instead of your application’s primary configuration, a nested `@TestConfiguration` class is used in addition to your application’s primary configuration.

|      | Spring’s test framework caches application contexts between tests. Therefore, as long as your tests share the same configuration (no matter how it is discovered), the potentially time-consuming process of loading the context happens only once. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Excluding Test Configuration

If your application uses component scanning (for example, if you use `@SpringBootApplication` or `@ComponentScan`), you may find top-level configuration classes that you created only for specific tests accidentally get picked up everywhere.

As we [have seen earlier](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-detecting-config), `@TestConfiguration` can be used on an inner class of a test to customize the primary configuration. When placed on a top-level class, `@TestConfiguration` indicates that classes in `src/test/java` should not be picked up by scanning. You can then import that class explicitly where it is required, as shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@Import(MyTestsConfiguration.class)
class MyTests {

    @Test
    void exampleTest() {
        ...
    }

}
```

|      | If you directly use `@ComponentScan` (that is, not through `@SpringBootApplication`) you need to register the `TypeExcludeFilter` with it. See [the Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/context/TypeExcludeFilter.html) for details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Using Application Arguments

If your application expects [arguments](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-application-arguments), you can have `@SpringBootTest` inject them using the `args` attribute.

```java
@SpringBootTest(args = "--app.test=one")
class ApplicationArgumentsExampleTests {

    @Test
    void applicationArgumentsPopulated(@Autowired ApplicationArguments args) {
        assertThat(args.getOptionNames()).containsOnly("app.test");
        assertThat(args.getOptionValues("app.test")).containsOnly("one");
    }

}
```

##### Testing with a mock environment

By default, `@SpringBootTest` does not start the server. If you have web endpoints that you want to test against this mock environment, you can additionally configure [`MockMvc`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference//testing.html#spring-mvc-test-framework) as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;

import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class MockMvcExampleTests {

    @Test
    void exampleTest(@Autowired MockMvc mvc) throws Exception {
        mvc.perform(get("/")).andExpect(status().isOk()).andExpect(content().string("Hello World"));
    }

}
```

|      | If you want to focus only on the web layer and not start a complete `ApplicationContext`, consider [using `@WebMvcTest` instead](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-mvc-tests). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Alternatively, you can configure a [`WebTestClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#webtestclient-tests) as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
class MockWebTestClientExampleTests {

    @Test
    void exampleTest(@Autowired WebTestClient webClient) {
        webClient.get().uri("/").exchange().expectStatus().isOk().expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("Hello World");
    }

}
```

|      | Testing within a mocked environment is usually faster than running with a full Servlet container. However, since mocking occurs at the Spring MVC layer, code that relies on lower-level Servlet container behavior cannot be directly tested with MockMvc.For example, Spring Boot’s error handling is based on the “error page” support provided by the Servlet container. This means that, whilst you can test your MVC layer throws and handles exceptions as expected, you cannot directly test that a specific [custom error page](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-error-handling-custom-error-pages) is rendered. If you need to test these lower-level concerns, you can start a fully running server as described in the next section. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Testing with a running server

If you need to start a full running server, we recommend that you use random ports. If you use `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)`, an available port is picked at random each time your test runs.

The `@LocalServerPort` annotation can be used to [inject the actual port used](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-discover-the-http-port-at-runtime) into your test. For convenience, tests that need to make REST calls to the started server can additionally `@Autowire` a [`WebTestClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#webtestclient-tests), which resolves relative links to the running server and comes with a dedicated API for verifying responses, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class RandomPortWebTestClientExampleTests {

    @Test
    void exampleTest(@Autowired WebTestClient webClient) {
        webClient.get().uri("/").exchange().expectStatus().isOk().expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("Hello World");
    }

}
```

This setup requires `spring-webflux` on the classpath. If you can’t or won’t add webflux, Spring Boot also provides a `TestRestTemplate` facility:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment;
import org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class RandomPortTestRestTemplateExampleTests {

    @Test
    void exampleTest(@Autowired TestRestTemplate restTemplate) {
        String body = restTemplate.getForObject("/", String.class);
        assertThat(body).isEqualTo("Hello World");
    }

}
```

##### Customizing WebTestClient

To customize the `WebTestClient` bean, configure a `WebTestClientBuilderCustomizer` bean. Any such beans are called with the `WebTestClient.Builder` that is used to create the `WebTestClient`.

##### Using JMX

As the test context framework caches context, JMX is disabled by default to prevent identical components to register on the same domain. If such test needs access to an `MBeanServer`, consider marking it dirty as well:

```java
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.jmx.enabled=true")
@DirtiesContext
class SampleJmxTests {

    @Autowired
    private MBeanServer mBeanServer;

    @Test
    void exampleTest() {
        // ...
    }

}
```

##### Mocking and Spying Beans

When running tests, it is sometimes necessary to mock certain components within your application context. For example, you may have a facade over some remote service that is unavailable during development. Mocking can also be useful when you want to simulate failures that might be hard to trigger in a real environment.

Spring Boot includes a `@MockBean` annotation that can be used to define a Mockito mock for a bean inside your `ApplicationContext`. You can use the annotation to add new beans or replace a single existing bean definition. The annotation can be used directly on test classes, on fields within your test, or on `@Configuration` classes and fields. When used on a field, the instance of the created mock is also injected. Mock beans are automatically reset after each test method.

|      | If your test uses one of Spring Boot’s test annotations (such as `@SpringBootTest`), this feature is automatically enabled. To use this feature with a different arrangement, a listener must be explicitly added, as shown in the following example:`@TestExecutionListeners(MockitoTestExecutionListener.class)` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following example replaces an existing `RemoteService` bean with a mock implementation:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.*;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;

@SpringBootTest
class MyTests {

    @MockBean
    private RemoteService remoteService;

    @Autowired
    private Reverser reverser;

    @Test
    void exampleTest() {
        // RemoteService has been injected into the reverser bean
        given(this.remoteService.someCall()).willReturn("mock");
        String reverse = reverser.reverseSomeCall();
        assertThat(reverse).isEqualTo("kcom");
    }

}
```

|      | `@MockBean` cannot be used to mock the behavior of a bean that’s exercised during application context refresh. By the time the test is executed, the application context refresh has completed and it is too late to configure the mocked behavior. We recommend using a `@Bean` method to create and configure the mock in this situation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Additionally, you can use `@SpyBean` to wrap any existing bean with a Mockito `spy`. See the [Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/SpyBean.html) for full details.

|      | CGLib proxies, such as those created for scoped beans, declare the proxied methods as `final`. This stops Mockito from functioning correctly as it cannot mock or spy on `final` methods in its default configuration. If you want to mock or spy on such a bean, configure Mockito to use its inline mock maker by adding `org.mockito:mockito-inline` to your application’s test dependencies. This allows Mockito to mock and spy on `final` methods. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | While Spring’s test framework caches application contexts between tests and reuses a context for tests sharing the same configuration, the use of `@MockBean` or `@SpyBean` influences the cache key, which will most likely increase the number of contexts. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you are using `@SpyBean` to spy on a bean with `@Cacheable` methods that refer to parameters by name, your application must be compiled with `-parameters`. This ensures that the parameter names are available to the caching infrastructure once the bean has been spied upon. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Auto-configured Tests

Spring Boot’s auto-configuration system works well for applications but can sometimes be a little too much for tests. It often helps to load only the parts of the configuration that are required to test a “slice” of your application. For example, you might want to test that Spring MVC controllers are mapping URLs correctly, and you do not want to involve database calls in those tests, or you might want to test JPA entities, and you are not interested in the web layer when those tests run.

The `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` module includes a number of annotations that can be used to automatically configure such “slices”. Each of them works in a similar way, providing a `@…Test` annotation that loads the `ApplicationContext` and one or more `@AutoConfigure…` annotations that can be used to customize auto-configuration settings.

|      | Each slice restricts component scan to appropriate components and loads a very restricted set of auto-configuration classes. If you need to exclude one of them, most `@…Test` annotations provide an `excludeAutoConfiguration` attribute. Alternatively, you can use `@ImportAutoConfiguration#exclude`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Including multiple “slices” by using several `@…Test` annotations in one test is not supported. If you need multiple “slices”, pick one of the `@…Test` annotations and include the `@AutoConfigure…` annotations of the other “slices” by hand. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | It is also possible to use the `@AutoConfigure…` annotations with the standard `@SpringBootTest` annotation. You can use this combination if you are not interested in “slicing” your application but you want some of the auto-configured test beans. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Auto-configured JSON Tests

To test that object JSON serialization and deserialization is working as expected, you can use the `@JsonTest` annotation. `@JsonTest` auto-configures the available supported JSON mapper, which can be one of the following libraries:

- Jackson `ObjectMapper`, any `@JsonComponent` beans and any Jackson `Module`s
- `Gson`
- `Jsonb`

|      | A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by `@JsonTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you need to configure elements of the auto-configuration, you can use the `@AutoConfigureJsonTesters` annotation.

Spring Boot includes AssertJ-based helpers that work with the JSONAssert and JsonPath libraries to check that JSON appears as expected. The `JacksonTester`, `GsonTester`, `JsonbTester`, and `BasicJsonTester` classes can be used for Jackson, Gson, Jsonb, and Strings respectively. Any helper fields on the test class can be `@Autowired` when using `@JsonTest`. The following example shows a test class for Jackson:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.json.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.json.*;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;

@JsonTest
class MyJsonTests {

    @Autowired
    private JacksonTester<VehicleDetails> json;

    @Test
    void testSerialize() throws Exception {
        VehicleDetails details = new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic");
        // Assert against a `.json` file in the same package as the test
        assertThat(this.json.write(details)).isEqualToJson("expected.json");
        // Or use JSON path based assertions
        assertThat(this.json.write(details)).hasJsonPathStringValue("@.make");
        assertThat(this.json.write(details)).extractingJsonPathStringValue("@.make")
                .isEqualTo("Honda");
    }

    @Test
    void testDeserialize() throws Exception {
        String content = "{\"make\":\"Ford\",\"model\":\"Focus\"}";
        assertThat(this.json.parse(content))
                .isEqualTo(new VehicleDetails("Ford", "Focus"));
        assertThat(this.json.parseObject(content).getMake()).isEqualTo("Ford");
    }

}
```

|      | JSON helper classes can also be used directly in standard unit tests. To do so, call the `initFields` method of the helper in your `@Before` method if you do not use `@JsonTest`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you’re using Spring Boot’s AssertJ-based helpers to assert on a number value at a given JSON path, you might not be able to use `isEqualTo` depending on the type. Instead, you can use AssertJ’s `satisfies` to assert that the value matches the given condition. For instance, the following example asserts that the actual number is a float value close to `0.15` within an offset of `0.01`.

```java
assertThat(json.write(message))
    .extractingJsonPathNumberValue("@.test.numberValue")
    .satisfies((number) -> assertThat(number.floatValue()).isCloseTo(0.15f, within(0.01f)));
```

##### Auto-configured Spring MVC Tests

To test whether Spring MVC controllers are working as expected, use the `@WebMvcTest` annotation. `@WebMvcTest` auto-configures the Spring MVC infrastructure and limits scanned beans to `@Controller`, `@ControllerAdvice`, `@JsonComponent`, `Converter`, `GenericConverter`, `Filter`, `HandlerInterceptor`, `WebMvcConfigurer`, and `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver`. Regular `@Component` beans are not scanned when using this annotation.

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@WebMvcTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you need to register extra components, such as the Jackson `Module`, you can import additional configuration classes by using `@Import` on your test. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Often, `@WebMvcTest` is limited to a single controller and is used in combination with `@MockBean` to provide mock implementations for required collaborators.

`@WebMvcTest` also auto-configures `MockMvc`. Mock MVC offers a powerful way to quickly test MVC controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server.

|      | You can also auto-configure `MockMvc` in a non-`@WebMvcTest` (such as `@SpringBootTest`) by annotating it with `@AutoConfigureMockMvc`. The following example uses `MockMvc`: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.*;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.*;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.*;

@WebMvcTest(UserVehicleController.class)
class MyControllerTests {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mvc;

    @MockBean
    private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;

    @Test
    void testExample() throws Exception {
        given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails("sboot"))
                .willReturn(new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic"));
        this.mvc.perform(get("/sboot/vehicle").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN))
                .andExpect(status().isOk()).andExpect(content().string("Honda Civic"));
    }

}
```

|      | If you need to configure elements of the auto-configuration (for example, when servlet filters should be applied) you can use attributes in the `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` annotation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you use HtmlUnit or Selenium, auto-configuration also provides an HtmlUnit `WebClient` bean and/or a Selenium `WebDriver` bean. The following example uses HtmlUnit:

```java
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.*;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.*;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;

@WebMvcTest(UserVehicleController.class)
class MyHtmlUnitTests {

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;

    @MockBean
    private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;

    @Test
    void testExample() throws Exception {
        given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails("sboot"))
                .willReturn(new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic"));
        HtmlPage page = this.webClient.getPage("/sboot/vehicle.html");
        assertThat(page.getBody().getTextContent()).isEqualTo("Honda Civic");
    }

}
```

|      | By default, Spring Boot puts `WebDriver` beans in a special “scope” to ensure that the driver exits after each test and that a new instance is injected. If you do not want this behavior, you can add `@Scope("singleton")` to your `WebDriver` `@Bean` definition. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | The `webDriver` scope created by Spring Boot will replace any user defined scope of the same name. If you define your own `webDriver` scope you may find it stops working when you use `@WebMvcTest`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you have Spring Security on the classpath, `@WebMvcTest` will also scan `WebSecurityConfigurer` beans. Instead of disabling security completely for such tests, you can use Spring Security’s test support. More details on how to use Spring Security’s `MockMvc` support can be found in this *[Testing With Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-test-with-spring-security)* how-to section.

|      | Sometimes writing Spring MVC tests is not enough; Spring Boot can help you run [full end-to-end tests with an actual server](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-with-running-server). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Auto-configured Spring WebFlux Tests

To test that [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference//web-reactive.html) controllers are working as expected, you can use the `@WebFluxTest` annotation. `@WebFluxTest` auto-configures the Spring WebFlux infrastructure and limits scanned beans to `@Controller`, `@ControllerAdvice`, `@JsonComponent`, `Converter`, `GenericConverter`, `WebFilter`, and `WebFluxConfigurer`. Regular `@Component` beans are not scanned when the `@WebFluxTest` annotation is used.

|      | A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by `@WebFluxTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you need to register extra components, such as Jackson `Module`, you can import additional configuration classes using `@Import` on your test. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Often, `@WebFluxTest` is limited to a single controller and used in combination with the `@MockBean` annotation to provide mock implementations for required collaborators.

`@WebFluxTest` also auto-configures [`WebTestClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#webtestclient), which offers a powerful way to quickly test WebFlux controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server.

|      | You can also auto-configure `WebTestClient` in a non-`@WebFluxTest` (such as `@SpringBootTest`) by annotating it with `@AutoConfigureWebTestClient`. The following example shows a class that uses both `@WebFluxTest` and a `WebTestClient`: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.WebFluxTest;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

@WebFluxTest(UserVehicleController.class)
class MyControllerTests {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webClient;

    @MockBean
    private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;

    @Test
    void testExample() throws Exception {
        given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails("sboot"))
                .willReturn(new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic"));
        this.webClient.get().uri("/sboot/vehicle").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().isOk()
                .expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("Honda Civic");
    }

}
```

|      | This setup is only supported by WebFlux applications as using `WebTestClient` in a mocked web application only works with WebFlux at the moment. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | `@WebFluxTest` cannot detect routes registered via the functional web framework. For testing `RouterFunction` beans in the context, consider importing your `RouterFunction` yourself via `@Import` or using `@SpringBootTest`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | `@WebFluxTest` cannot detect custom security configuration registered via a `@Bean` of type `SecurityWebFilterChain`. To include that in your test, you will need to import the configuration that registers the bean via `@Import` or use `@SpringBootTest`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Sometimes writing Spring WebFlux tests is not enough; Spring Boot can help you run [full end-to-end tests with an actual server](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-with-running-server). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Auto-configured Data JPA Tests

You can use the `@DataJpaTest` annotation to test JPA applications. By default, it scans for `@Entity` classes and configures Spring Data JPA repositories. If an embedded database is available on the classpath, it configures one as well. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`.

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@DataJpaTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, data JPA tests are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. See the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#testcontext-tx-enabling-transactions) in the Spring Framework Reference Documentation for more details. If that is not what you want, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class as follows:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.DataJpaTest;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@DataJpaTest
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
class ExampleNonTransactionalTests {

}
```

Data JPA tests may also inject a [`TestEntityManager`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-test-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/test/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/TestEntityManager.java) bean, which provides an alternative to the standard JPA `EntityManager` that is specifically designed for tests. If you want to use `TestEntityManager` outside of `@DataJpaTest` instances, you can also use the `@AutoConfigureTestEntityManager` annotation. A `JdbcTemplate` is also available if you need that. The following example shows the `@DataJpaTest` annotation in use:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.*;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;

@DataJpaTest
class ExampleRepositoryTests {

    @Autowired
    private TestEntityManager entityManager;

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository repository;

    @Test
    void testExample() throws Exception {
        this.entityManager.persist(new User("sboot", "1234"));
        User user = this.repository.findByUsername("sboot");
        assertThat(user.getUsername()).isEqualTo("sboot");
        assertThat(user.getVin()).isEqualTo("1234");
    }

}
```

In-memory embedded databases generally work well for tests, since they are fast and do not require any installation. If, however, you prefer to run tests against a real database you can use the `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` annotation, as shown in the following example:

```java
@DataJpaTest
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace=Replace.NONE)
class ExampleRepositoryTests {

    // ...

}
```

##### Auto-configured JDBC Tests

`@JdbcTest` is similar to `@DataJpaTest` but is for tests that only require a `DataSource` and do not use Spring Data JDBC. By default, it configures an in-memory embedded database and a `JdbcTemplate`. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`.

|      | A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by `@JdbcTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, JDBC tests are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. See the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#testcontext-tx-enabling-transactions) in the Spring Framework Reference Documentation for more details. If that is not what you want, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class, as follows:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.jdbc.JdbcTest;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@JdbcTest
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
class ExampleNonTransactionalTests {

}
```

If you prefer your test to run against a real database, you can use the `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` annotation in the same way as for `DataJpaTest`. (See "[Auto-configured Data JPA Tests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jpa-test)".)

##### Auto-configured Data JDBC Tests

`@DataJdbcTest` is similar to `@JdbcTest` but is for tests that use Spring Data JDBC repositories. By default, it configures an in-memory embedded database, a `JdbcTemplate`, and Spring Data JDBC repositories. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`.

|      | A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by `@DataJdbcTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, Data JDBC tests are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. See the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#testcontext-tx-enabling-transactions) in the Spring Framework Reference Documentation for more details. If that is not what you want, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole test class as [shown in the JDBC example](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jdbc-test).

If you prefer your test to run against a real database, you can use the `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` annotation in the same way as for `DataJpaTest`. (See "[Auto-configured Data JPA Tests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jpa-test)".)

##### Auto-configured jOOQ Tests

You can use `@JooqTest` in a similar fashion as `@JdbcTest` but for jOOQ-related tests. As jOOQ relies heavily on a Java-based schema that corresponds with the database schema, the existing `DataSource` is used. If you want to replace it with an in-memory database, you can use `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` to override those settings. (For more about using jOOQ with Spring Boot, see "[Using jOOQ](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-jooq)", earlier in this chapter.) Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`.

|      | A list of the auto-configurations that are enabled by `@JooqTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

`@JooqTest` configures a `DSLContext`. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`. The following example shows the `@JooqTest` annotation in use:

```java
import org.jooq.DSLContext;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.jooq.JooqTest;

@JooqTest
class ExampleJooqTests {

    @Autowired
    private DSLContext dslContext;
}
```

JOOQ tests are transactional and roll back at the end of each test by default. If that is not what you want, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole test class as [shown in the JDBC example](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jdbc-test).

##### Auto-configured Data MongoDB Tests

You can use `@DataMongoTest` to test MongoDB applications. By default, it configures an in-memory embedded MongoDB (if available), configures a `MongoTemplate`, scans for `@Document` classes, and configures Spring Data MongoDB repositories. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`. (For more about using MongoDB with Spring Boot, see "[MongoDB](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-mongodb)", earlier in this chapter.)

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@DataMongoTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following class shows the `@DataMongoTest` annotation in use:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.mongo.DataMongoTest;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate;

@DataMongoTest
class ExampleDataMongoTests {

    @Autowired
    private MongoTemplate mongoTemplate;

    //
}
```

In-memory embedded MongoDB generally works well for tests, since it is fast and does not require any developer installation. If, however, you prefer to run tests against a real MongoDB server, you should exclude the embedded MongoDB auto-configuration, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.embedded.EmbeddedMongoAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.mongo.DataMongoTest;

@DataMongoTest(excludeAutoConfiguration = EmbeddedMongoAutoConfiguration.class)
class ExampleDataMongoNonEmbeddedTests {

}
```

##### Auto-configured Data Neo4j Tests

You can use `@DataNeo4jTest` to test Neo4j applications. By default, it uses an in-memory embedded Neo4j (if the embedded driver is available), scans for `@NodeEntity` classes, and configures Spring Data Neo4j repositories. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`. (For more about using Neo4J with Spring Boot, see "[Neo4j](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-neo4j)", earlier in this chapter.)

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@DataNeo4jTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following example shows a typical setup for using Neo4J tests in Spring Boot:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.neo4j.DataNeo4jTest;

@DataNeo4jTest
class ExampleDataNeo4jTests {

    @Autowired
    private YourRepository repository;

    //
}
```

By default, Data Neo4j tests are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. See the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#testcontext-tx-enabling-transactions) in the Spring Framework Reference Documentation for more details. If that is not what you want, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class, as follows:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.neo4j.DataNeo4jTest;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@DataNeo4jTest
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
class ExampleNonTransactionalTests {

}
```

##### Auto-configured Data Redis Tests

You can use `@DataRedisTest` to test Redis applications. By default, it scans for `@RedisHash` classes and configures Spring Data Redis repositories. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`. (For more about using Redis with Spring Boot, see "[Redis](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-redis)", earlier in this chapter.)

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@DataRedisTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following example shows the `@DataRedisTest` annotation in use:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.redis.DataRedisTest;

@DataRedisTest
class ExampleDataRedisTests {

    @Autowired
    private YourRepository repository;

    //
}
```

##### Auto-configured Data LDAP Tests

You can use `@DataLdapTest` to test LDAP applications. By default, it configures an in-memory embedded LDAP (if available), configures an `LdapTemplate`, scans for `@Entry` classes, and configures Spring Data LDAP repositories. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`. (For more about using LDAP with Spring Boot, see "[LDAP](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-ldap)", earlier in this chapter.)

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@DataLdapTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following example shows the `@DataLdapTest` annotation in use:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.ldap.DataLdapTest;
import org.springframework.ldap.core.LdapTemplate;

@DataLdapTest
class ExampleDataLdapTests {

    @Autowired
    private LdapTemplate ldapTemplate;

    //
}
```

In-memory embedded LDAP generally works well for tests, since it is fast and does not require any developer installation. If, however, you prefer to run tests against a real LDAP server, you should exclude the embedded LDAP auto-configuration, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.ldap.embedded.EmbeddedLdapAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.ldap.DataLdapTest;

@DataLdapTest(excludeAutoConfiguration = EmbeddedLdapAutoConfiguration.class)
class ExampleDataLdapNonEmbeddedTests {

}
```

##### Auto-configured REST Clients

You can use the `@RestClientTest` annotation to test REST clients. By default, it auto-configures Jackson, GSON, and Jsonb support, configures a `RestTemplateBuilder`, and adds support for `MockRestServiceServer`. Regular `@Component` beans are not loaded into the `ApplicationContext`.

|      | A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@RestClientTest` can be [found in the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test-auto-configuration). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The specific beans that you want to test should be specified by using the `value` or `components` attribute of `@RestClientTest`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@RestClientTest(RemoteVehicleDetailsService.class)
class ExampleRestClientTest {

    @Autowired
    private RemoteVehicleDetailsService service;

    @Autowired
    private MockRestServiceServer server;

    @Test
    void getVehicleDetailsWhenResultIsSuccessShouldReturnDetails()
            throws Exception {
        this.server.expect(requestTo("/greet/details"))
                .andRespond(withSuccess("hello", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN));
        String greeting = this.service.callRestService();
        assertThat(greeting).isEqualTo("hello");
    }

}
```

##### Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests

You can use the `@AutoConfigureRestDocs` annotation to use [Spring REST Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs) in your tests with Mock MVC, REST Assured, or WebTestClient. It removes the need for the JUnit extension in Spring REST Docs.

`@AutoConfigureRestDocs` can be used to override the default output directory (`target/generated-snippets` if you are using Maven or `build/generated-snippets` if you are using Gradle). It can also be used to configure the host, scheme, and port that appears in any documented URIs.

###### Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests with Mock MVC

`@AutoConfigureRestDocs` customizes the `MockMvc` bean to use Spring REST Docs. You can inject it by using `@Autowired` and use it in your tests as you normally would when using Mock MVC and Spring REST Docs, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;

import static org.springframework.restdocs.mockmvc.MockMvcRestDocumentation.document;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.*;

@WebMvcTest(UserController.class)
@AutoConfigureRestDocs
class UserDocumentationTests {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mvc;

    @Test
    void listUsers() throws Exception {
        this.mvc.perform(get("/users").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andDo(document("list-users"));
    }

}
```

If you require more control over Spring REST Docs configuration than offered by the attributes of `@AutoConfigureRestDocs`, you can use a `RestDocsMockMvcConfigurationCustomizer` bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
@TestConfiguration
static class CustomizationConfiguration
        implements RestDocsMockMvcConfigurationCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(MockMvcRestDocumentationConfigurer configurer) {
        configurer.snippets().withTemplateFormat(TemplateFormats.markdown());
    }

}
```

If you want to make use of Spring REST Docs support for a parameterized output directory, you can create a `RestDocumentationResultHandler` bean. The auto-configuration calls `alwaysDo` with this result handler, thereby causing each `MockMvc` call to automatically generate the default snippets. The following example shows a `RestDocumentationResultHandler` being defined:

```java
@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
static class ResultHandlerConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public RestDocumentationResultHandler restDocumentation() {
        return MockMvcRestDocumentation.document("{method-name}");
    }

}
```

###### Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests with WebTestClient

`@AutoConfigureRestDocs` can also be used with `WebTestClient`. You can inject it by using `@Autowired` and use it in your tests as you normally would when using `@WebFluxTest` and Spring REST Docs, as shown in the following example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.restdocs.AutoConfigureRestDocs;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.WebFluxTest;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.restdocs.webtestclient.WebTestClientRestDocumentation.document;

@WebFluxTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs
class UsersDocumentationTests {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    @Test
    void listUsers() {
        this.webTestClient.get().uri("/").exchange().expectStatus().isOk().expectBody()
                .consumeWith(document("list-users"));
    }

}
```

If you require more control over Spring REST Docs configuration than offered by the attributes of `@AutoConfigureRestDocs`, you can use a `RestDocsWebTestClientConfigurationCustomizer` bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public static class CustomizationConfiguration implements RestDocsWebTestClientConfigurationCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(WebTestClientRestDocumentationConfigurer configurer) {
        configurer.snippets().withEncoding("UTF-8");
    }

}
```

###### Auto-configured Spring REST Docs Tests with REST Assured

`@AutoConfigureRestDocs` makes a `RequestSpecification` bean, preconfigured to use Spring REST Docs, available to your tests. You can inject it by using `@Autowired` and use it in your tests as you normally would when using REST Assured and Spring REST Docs, as shown in the following example:

```java
import io.restassured.specification.RequestSpecification;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.restdocs.AutoConfigureRestDocs;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment;
import org.springframework.boot.web.server.LocalServerPort;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.is;
import static org.springframework.restdocs.restassured3.RestAssuredRestDocumentation.document;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureRestDocs
class UserDocumentationTests {

    @Test
    void listUsers(@Autowired RequestSpecification documentationSpec, @LocalServerPort int port) {
        given(documentationSpec).filter(document("list-users")).when().port(port).get("/").then().assertThat()
                .statusCode(is(200));
    }

}
```

If you require more control over Spring REST Docs configuration than offered by the attributes of `@AutoConfigureRestDocs`, a `RestDocsRestAssuredConfigurationCustomizer` bean can be used, as shown in the following example:

```java
@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public static class CustomizationConfiguration implements RestDocsRestAssuredConfigurationCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(RestAssuredRestDocumentationConfigurer configurer) {
        configurer.snippets().withTemplateFormat(TemplateFormats.markdown());
    }

}
```

##### Additional Auto-configuration and Slicing

Each slice provides one or more `@AutoConfigure…` annotations that namely defines the auto-configurations that should be included as part of a slice. Additional auto-configurations can be added by creating a custom `@AutoConfigure…` annotation or simply by adding `@ImportAutoConfiguration` to the test as shown in the following example:

```java
@JdbcTest
@ImportAutoConfiguration(IntegrationAutoConfiguration.class)
class ExampleJdbcTests {

}
```

|      | Make sure to not use the regular `@Import` annotation to import auto-configurations as they are handled in a specific way by Spring Boot. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### User Configuration and Slicing

If you [structure your code](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-structuring-your-code) in a sensible way, your `@SpringBootApplication` class is [used by default](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-detecting-config) as the configuration of your tests.

It then becomes important not to litter the application’s main class with configuration settings that are specific to a particular area of its functionality.

Assume that you are using Spring Batch and you rely on the auto-configuration for it. You could define your `@SpringBootApplication` as follows:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class SampleApplication { ... }
```

Because this class is the source configuration for the test, any slice test actually tries to start Spring Batch, which is definitely not what you want to do. A recommended approach is to move that area-specific configuration to a separate `@Configuration` class at the same level as your application, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class BatchConfiguration { ... }
```

|      | Depending on the complexity of your application, you may either have a single `@Configuration` class for your customizations or one class per domain area. The latter approach lets you enable it in one of your tests, if necessary, with the `@Import` annotation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Test slices exclude `@Configuration` classes from scanning. For example, for a `@WebMvcTest`, the following configuration will not include the given `WebMvcConfigurer` bean in the application context loaded by the test slice:

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer testConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
            ...
        };
    }
}
```

The configuration below will, however, cause the custom `WebMvcConfigurer` to be loaded by the test slice.

```java
@Component
public class TestWebMvcConfigurer implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    ...
}
```

Another source of confusion is classpath scanning. Assume that, while you structured your code in a sensible way, you need to scan an additional package. Your application may resemble the following code:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan({ "com.example.app", "org.acme.another" })
public class SampleApplication { ... }
```

Doing so effectively overrides the default component scan directive with the side effect of scanning those two packages regardless of the slice that you chose. For instance, a `@DataJpaTest` seems to suddenly scan components and user configurations of your application. Again, moving the custom directive to a separate class is a good way to fix this issue.

|      | If this is not an option for you, you can create a `@SpringBootConfiguration` somewhere in the hierarchy of your test so that it is used instead. Alternatively, you can specify a source for your test, which disables the behavior of finding a default one. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Using Spock to Test Spring Boot Applications

If you wish to use Spock to test a Spring Boot application, you should add a dependency on Spock’s `spock-spring` module to your application’s build. `spock-spring` integrates Spring’s test framework into Spock. It is recommended that you use Spock 1.2 or later to benefit from a number of improvements to Spock’s Spring Framework and Spring Boot integration. See [the documentation for Spock’s Spring module](http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.2/modules.html#_spring_module) for further details.

#### 4.25.4. Test Utilities

A few test utility classes that are generally useful when testing your application are packaged as part of `spring-boot`.

##### ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer

`ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer` is an `ApplicationContextInitializer` that you can apply to your tests to load Spring Boot `application.properties` files. You can use it when you do not need the full set of features provided by `@SpringBootTest`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config.class,
    initializers = ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer.class)
```

|      | Using `ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer` alone does not provide support for `@Value("${…}")` injection. Its only job is to ensure that `application.properties` files are loaded into Spring’s `Environment`. For `@Value` support, you need to either additionally configure a `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` or use `@SpringBootTest`, which auto-configures one for you. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### TestPropertyValues

`TestPropertyValues` lets you quickly add properties to a `ConfigurableEnvironment` or `ConfigurableApplicationContext`. You can call it with `key=value` strings, as follows:

```java
TestPropertyValues.of("org=Spring", "name=Boot").applyTo(env);
```

##### OutputCapture

`OutputCapture` is a JUnit `Extension` that you can use to capture `System.out` and `System.err` output. To use add `@ExtendWith(OutputCaptureExtension.class)` and inject `CapturedOutput` as an argument to your test class constructor or test method as follows:

```java
@ExtendWith(OutputCaptureExtension.class)
class OutputCaptureTests {

    @Test
    void testName(CapturedOutput output) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        assertThat(output).contains("World");
    }

}
```

##### TestRestTemplate

`TestRestTemplate` is a convenience alternative to Spring’s `RestTemplate` that is useful in integration tests. You can get a vanilla template or one that sends Basic HTTP authentication (with a username and password). In either case, the template behaves in a test-friendly way by not throwing exceptions on server-side errors.

|      | Spring Framework 5.0 provides a new `WebTestClient` that works for [WebFlux integration tests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-webflux-tests) and both [WebFlux and MVC end-to-end testing](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-with-running-server). It provides a fluent API for assertions, unlike `TestRestTemplate`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

It is recommended, but not mandatory, to use the Apache HTTP Client (version 4.3.2 or better). If you have that on your classpath, the `TestRestTemplate` responds by configuring the client appropriately. If you do use Apache’s HTTP client, some additional test-friendly features are enabled:

- Redirects are not followed (so you can assert the response location).
- Cookies are ignored (so the template is stateless).

`TestRestTemplate` can be instantiated directly in your integration tests, as shown in the following example:

```java
public class MyTest {

    private TestRestTemplate template = new TestRestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void testRequest() throws Exception {
        HttpHeaders headers = this.template.getForEntity(
                "https://myhost.example.com/example", String.class).getHeaders();
        assertThat(headers.getLocation()).hasHost("other.example.com");
    }

}
```

Alternatively, if you use the `@SpringBootTest` annotation with `WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT` or `WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT`, you can inject a fully configured `TestRestTemplate` and start using it. If necessary, additional customizations can be applied through the `RestTemplateBuilder` bean. Any URLs that do not specify a host and port automatically connect to the embedded server, as shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class SampleWebClientTests {

    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate template;

    @Test
    void testRequest() {
        HttpHeaders headers = this.template.getForEntity("/example", String.class).getHeaders();
        assertThat(headers.getLocation()).hasHost("other.example.com");
    }

    @TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
    static class Config {

        @Bean
        RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder() {
            return new RestTemplateBuilder().setConnectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                    .setReadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
        }

    }

}
```

### 4.26. WebSockets

Spring Boot provides WebSockets auto-configuration for embedded Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. If you deploy a war file to a standalone container, Spring Boot assumes that the container is responsible for the configuration of its WebSocket support.

Spring Framework provides [rich WebSocket support](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#websocket) for MVC web applications that can be easily accessed through the `spring-boot-starter-websocket` module.

WebSocket support is also available for [reactive web applications](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-websocket) and requires to include the WebSocket API alongside `spring-boot-starter-webflux`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.websocket</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.websocket-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 4.27. Web Services

Spring Boot provides Web Services auto-configuration so that all you must do is define your `Endpoints`.

The [Spring Web Services features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/3.0.9.RELEASE/reference/) can be easily accessed with the `spring-boot-starter-webservices` module.

`SimpleWsdl11Definition` and `SimpleXsdSchema` beans can be automatically created for your WSDLs and XSDs respectively. To do so, configure their location, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.webservices.wsdl-locations=classpath:/wsdl
```

#### 4.27.1. Calling Web Services with `WebServiceTemplate`

If you need to call remote Web services from your application, you can use the [`WebServiceTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/3.0.9.RELEASE/reference/#client-web-service-template) class. Since `WebServiceTemplate` instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured `WebServiceTemplate` bean. It does, however, auto-configure a `WebServiceTemplateBuilder`, which can be used to create `WebServiceTemplate` instances when needed.

The following code shows a typical example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate;

    public MyService(WebServiceTemplateBuilder webServiceTemplateBuilder) {
        this.webServiceTemplate = webServiceTemplateBuilder.build();
    }

    public DetailsResp someWsCall(DetailsReq detailsReq) {
         return (DetailsResp) this.webServiceTemplate.marshalSendAndReceive(detailsReq, new SoapActionCallback(ACTION));
    }

}
```

By default, `WebServiceTemplateBuilder` detects a suitable HTTP-based `WebServiceMessageSender` using the available HTTP client libraries on the classpath. You can also customize read and connection timeouts as follows:

```java
@Bean
public WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate(WebServiceTemplateBuilder builder) {
    return builder.messageSenders(new HttpWebServiceMessageSenderBuilder()
            .setConnectTimeout(5000).setReadTimeout(2000).build()).build();
}
```

### 4.28. Creating Your Own Auto-configuration

If you work in a company that develops shared libraries, or if you work on an open-source or commercial library, you might want to develop your own auto-configuration. Auto-configuration classes can be bundled in external jars and still be picked-up by Spring Boot.

Auto-configuration can be associated to a “starter” that provides the auto-configuration code as well as the typical libraries that you would use with it. We first cover what you need to know to build your own auto-configuration and then we move on to the [typical steps required to create a custom starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-starter).

|      | A [demo project](https://github.com/snicoll-demos/spring-boot-master-auto-configuration) is available to showcase how you can create a starter step-by-step. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.28.1. Understanding Auto-configured Beans

Under the hood, auto-configuration is implemented with standard `@Configuration` classes. Additional `@Conditional` annotations are used to constrain when the auto-configuration should apply. Usually, auto-configuration classes use `@ConditionalOnClass` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations. This ensures that auto-configuration applies only when relevant classes are found and when you have not declared your own `@Configuration`.

You can browse the source code of [`spring-boot-autoconfigure`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure) to see the `@Configuration` classes that Spring provides (see the [`META-INF/spring.factories`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories) file).

#### 4.28.2. Locating Auto-configuration Candidates

Spring Boot checks for the presence of a `META-INF/spring.factories` file within your published jar. The file should list your configuration classes under the `EnableAutoConfiguration` key, as shown in the following example:

```
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
com.mycorp.libx.autoconfigure.LibXAutoConfiguration,\
com.mycorp.libx.autoconfigure.LibXWebAutoConfiguration
```

|      | Auto-configurations must be loaded that way *only*. Make sure that they are defined in a specific package space and that they are never the target of component scanning. Furthermore, auto-configuration classes should not enable component scanning to find additional components. Specific `@Import`s should be used instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can use the [`@AutoConfigureAfter`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/AutoConfigureAfter.java) or [`@AutoConfigureBefore`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/AutoConfigureBefore.java) annotations if your configuration needs to be applied in a specific order. For example, if you provide web-specific configuration, your class may need to be applied after `WebMvcAutoConfiguration`.

If you want to order certain auto-configurations that should not have any direct knowledge of each other, you can also use `@AutoConfigureOrder`. That annotation has the same semantic as the regular `@Order` annotation but provides a dedicated order for auto-configuration classes.

As with standard `@Configuration` classes, the order in which auto-configuration classes are applied only affects the order in which their beans are defined. The order in which those beans are subsequently created is unaffected and is determined by each bean’s dependencies and any `@DependsOn` relationships.

#### 4.28.3. Condition Annotations

You almost always want to include one or more `@Conditional` annotations on your auto-configuration class. The `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotation is one common example that is used to allow developers to override auto-configuration if they are not happy with your defaults.

Spring Boot includes a number of `@Conditional` annotations that you can reuse in your own code by annotating `@Configuration` classes or individual `@Bean` methods. These annotations include:

- [Class Conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-class-conditions)
- [Bean Conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-bean-conditions)
- [Property Conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-property-conditions)
- [Resource Conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-resource-conditions)
- [Web Application Conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-web-application-conditions)
- [SpEL Expression Conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spel-conditions)

##### Class Conditions

The `@ConditionalOnClass` and `@ConditionalOnMissingClass` annotations let `@Configuration` classes be included based on the presence or absence of specific classes. Due to the fact that annotation metadata is parsed by using [ASM](https://asm.ow2.org/), you can use the `value` attribute to refer to the real class, even though that class might not actually appear on the running application classpath. You can also use the `name` attribute if you prefer to specify the class name by using a `String` value.

This mechanism does not apply the same way to `@Bean` methods where typically the return type is the target of the condition: before the condition on the method applies, the JVM will have loaded the class and potentially processed method references which will fail if the class is not present.

To handle this scenario, a separate `@Configuration` class can be used to isolate the condition, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
// Some conditions
public class MyAutoConfiguration {

    // Auto-configured beans

    @Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
    @ConditionalOnClass(EmbeddedAcmeService.class)
    static class EmbeddedConfiguration {

        @Bean
        @ConditionalOnMissingBean
        public EmbeddedAcmeService embeddedAcmeService() { ... }

    }

}
```

|      | If you use `@ConditionalOnClass` or `@ConditionalOnMissingClass` as a part of a meta-annotation to compose your own composed annotations, you must use `name` as referring to the class in such a case is not handled. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Bean Conditions

The `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations let a bean be included based on the presence or absence of specific beans. You can use the `value` attribute to specify beans by type or `name` to specify beans by name. The `search` attribute lets you limit the `ApplicationContext` hierarchy that should be considered when searching for beans.

When placed on a `@Bean` method, the target type defaults to the return type of the method, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class MyAutoConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public MyService myService() { ... }

}
```

In the preceding example, the `myService` bean is going to be created if no bean of type `MyService` is already contained in the `ApplicationContext`.

|      | You need to be very careful about the order in which bean definitions are added, as these conditions are evaluated based on what has been processed so far. For this reason, we recommend using only `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations on auto-configuration classes (since these are guaranteed to load after any user-defined bean definitions have been added). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` do not prevent `@Configuration` classes from being created. The only difference between using these conditions at the class level and marking each contained `@Bean` method with the annotation is that the former prevents registration of the `@Configuration` class as a bean if the condition does not match. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Property Conditions

The `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotation lets configuration be included based on a Spring Environment property. Use the `prefix` and `name` attributes to specify the property that should be checked. By default, any property that exists and is not equal to `false` is matched. You can also create more advanced checks by using the `havingValue` and `matchIfMissing` attributes.

##### Resource Conditions

The `@ConditionalOnResource` annotation lets configuration be included only when a specific resource is present. Resources can be specified by using the usual Spring conventions, as shown in the following example: `file:/home/user/test.dat`.

##### Web Application Conditions

The `@ConditionalOnWebApplication` and `@ConditionalOnNotWebApplication` annotations let configuration be included depending on whether the application is a “web application”. A servlet-based web application is any application that uses a Spring `WebApplicationContext`, defines a `session` scope, or has a `ConfigurableWebEnvironment`. A reactive web application is any application that uses a `ReactiveWebApplicationContext`, or has a `ConfigurableReactiveWebEnvironment`.

##### SpEL Expression Conditions

The `@ConditionalOnExpression` annotation lets configuration be included based on the result of a [SpEL expression](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions).

#### 4.28.4. Testing your Auto-configuration

An auto-configuration can be affected by many factors: user configuration (`@Bean` definition and `Environment` customization), condition evaluation (presence of a particular library), and others. Concretely, each test should create a well defined `ApplicationContext` that represents a combination of those customizations. `ApplicationContextRunner` provides a great way to achieve that.

`ApplicationContextRunner` is usually defined as a field of the test class to gather the base, common configuration. The following example makes sure that `UserServiceAutoConfiguration` is always invoked:

```java
private final ApplicationContextRunner contextRunner = new ApplicationContextRunner()
        .withConfiguration(AutoConfigurations.of(UserServiceAutoConfiguration.class));
```

|      | If multiple auto-configurations have to be defined, there is no need to order their declarations as they are invoked in the exact same order as when running the application. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Each test can use the runner to represent a particular use case. For instance, the sample below invokes a user configuration (`UserConfiguration`) and checks that the auto-configuration backs off properly. Invoking `run` provides a callback context that can be used with `Assert4J`.

```java
@Test
void defaultServiceBacksOff() {
    this.contextRunner.withUserConfiguration(UserConfiguration.class).run((context) -> {
        assertThat(context).hasSingleBean(UserService.class);
        assertThat(context).getBean("myUserService").isSameAs(context.getBean(UserService.class));
    });
}

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
static class UserConfiguration {

    @Bean
    UserService myUserService() {
        return new UserService("mine");
    }

}
```

It is also possible to easily customize the `Environment`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Test
void serviceNameCanBeConfigured() {
    this.contextRunner.withPropertyValues("user.name=test123").run((context) -> {
        assertThat(context).hasSingleBean(UserService.class);
        assertThat(context.getBean(UserService.class).getName()).isEqualTo("test123");
    });
}
```

The runner can also be used to display the `ConditionEvaluationReport`. The report can be printed at `INFO` or `DEBUG` level. The following example shows how to use the `ConditionEvaluationReportLoggingListener` to print the report in auto-configuration tests.

```java
@Test
public void autoConfigTest {
    ConditionEvaluationReportLoggingListener initializer = new ConditionEvaluationReportLoggingListener(
            LogLevel.INFO);
    ApplicationContextRunner contextRunner = new ApplicationContextRunner()
            .withInitializer(initializer).run((context) -> {
                    // Do something...
            });
}
```

##### Simulating a Web Context

If you need to test an auto-configuration that only operates in a Servlet or Reactive web application context, use the `WebApplicationContextRunner` or `ReactiveWebApplicationContextRunner` respectively.

##### Overriding the Classpath

It is also possible to test what happens when a particular class and/or package is not present at runtime. Spring Boot ships with a `FilteredClassLoader` that can easily be used by the runner. In the following example, we assert that if `UserService` is not present, the auto-configuration is properly disabled:

```java
@Test
void serviceIsIgnoredIfLibraryIsNotPresent() {
    this.contextRunner.withClassLoader(new FilteredClassLoader(UserService.class))
            .run((context) -> assertThat(context).doesNotHaveBean("userService"));
}
```

#### 4.28.5. Creating Your Own Starter

A typical Spring Boot starter contains code to auto-configure and customize the infrastructure of a given technology, let’s call that "acme". To make it easily extensible, a number of configuration keys in a dedicated namespace can be exposed to the environment. Finally, a single "starter" dependency is provided to help users get started as easily as possible.

Concretely, a custom starter can contain the following:

- The `autoconfigure` module that contains the auto-configuration code for "acme".
- The `starter` module that provides a dependency to the `autoconfigure` module as well as "acme" and any additional dependencies that are typically useful. In a nutshell, adding the starter should provide everything needed to start using that library.

This separation in two modules is in no way necessary. If "acme" has several flavours, options or optional features, then it is better to separate the auto-configuration as you can clearly express the fact some features are optional. Besides, you have the ability to craft a starter that provides an opinion about those optional dependencies. At the same time, others can rely only on the `autoconfigure` module and craft their own starter with different opinions.

If the auto-configuration is relatively straightforward and does not have optional feature, merging the two modules in the starter is definitely an option.

##### Naming

You should make sure to provide a proper namespace for your starter. Do not start your module names with `spring-boot`, even if you use a different Maven `groupId`. We may offer official support for the thing you auto-configure in the future.

As a rule of thumb, you should name a combined module after the starter. For example, assume that you are creating a starter for "acme" and that you name the auto-configure module `acme-spring-boot` and the starter `acme-spring-boot-starter`. If you only have one module that combines the two, name it `acme-spring-boot-starter`.

##### Configuration keys

If your starter provides configuration keys, use a unique namespace for them. In particular, do not include your keys in the namespaces that Spring Boot uses (such as `server`, `management`, `spring`, and so on). If you use the same namespace, we may modify these namespaces in the future in ways that break your modules. As a rule of thumb, prefix all your keys with a namespace that you own (e.g. `acme`).

Make sure that configuration keys are documented by adding field javadoc for each property, as shown in the following example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    /**
     * Whether to check the location of acme resources.
     */
    private boolean checkLocation = true;

    /**
     * Timeout for establishing a connection to the acme server.
     */
    private Duration loginTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(3);

    // getters & setters

}
```

|      | You should only use plain text with `@ConfigurationProperties` field Javadoc, since they are not processed before being added to the JSON. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Here are some rules we follow internally to make sure descriptions are consistent:

- Do not start the description by "The" or "A".
- For `boolean` types, start the description with "Whether" or "Enable".
- For collection-based types, start the description with "Comma-separated list"
- Use `java.time.Duration` rather than `long` and describe the default unit if it differs from milliseconds, e.g. "If a duration suffix is not specified, seconds will be used".
- Do not provide the default value in the description unless it has to be determined at runtime.

Make sure to [trigger meta-data generation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-annotation-processor) so that IDE assistance is available for your keys as well. You may want to review the generated metadata (`META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json`) to make sure your keys are properly documented. Using your own starter in a compatible IDE is also a good idea to validate that quality of the metadata.

##### `autoconfigure` Module

The `autoconfigure` module contains everything that is necessary to get started with the library. It may also contain configuration key definitions (such as `@ConfigurationProperties`) and any callback interface that can be used to further customize how the components are initialized.

|      | You should mark the dependencies to the library as optional so that you can include the `autoconfigure` module in your projects more easily. If you do it that way, the library is not provided and, by default, Spring Boot backs off. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot uses an annotation processor to collect the conditions on auto-configurations in a metadata file (`META-INF/spring-autoconfigure-metadata.properties`). If that file is present, it is used to eagerly filter auto-configurations that do not match, which will improve startup time. It is recommended to add the following dependency in a module that contains auto-configurations:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

If you have defined auto-configurations directly in your application, make sure to configure the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` to prevent the `repackage` goal from adding the dependency into the fat jar:

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <excludes>
                        <exclude>
                            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                            <artifactId>spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor</artifactId>
                        </exclude>
                    </excludes>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

With Gradle 4.5 and earlier, the dependency should be declared in the `compileOnly` configuration, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor"
}
```

With Gradle 4.6 and later, the dependency should be declared in the `annotationProcessor` configuration, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    annotationProcessor "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor"
}
```

##### Starter Module

The starter is really an empty jar. Its only purpose is to provide the necessary dependencies to work with the library. You can think of it as an opinionated view of what is required to get started.

Do not make assumptions about the project in which your starter is added. If the library you are auto-configuring typically requires other starters, mention them as well. Providing a proper set of *default* dependencies may be hard if the number of optional dependencies is high, as you should avoid including dependencies that are unnecessary for a typical usage of the library. In other words, you should not include optional dependencies.

|      | Either way, your starter must reference the core Spring Boot starter (`spring-boot-starter`) directly or indirectly (i.e. no need to add it if your starter relies on another starter). If a project is created with only your custom starter, Spring Boot’s core features will be honoured by the presence of the core starter. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 4.29. Kotlin support

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a statically-typed language targeting the JVM (and other platforms) which allows writing concise and elegant code while providing [interoperability](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html) with existing libraries written in Java.

Spring Boot provides Kotlin support by leveraging the support in other Spring projects such as Spring Framework, Spring Data, and Reactor. See the [Spring Framework Kotlin support documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/languages.html#kotlin) for more information.

The easiest way to start with Spring Boot and Kotlin is to follow [this comprehensive tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/). You can create new Kotlin projects via [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin). Feel free to join the #spring channel of [Kotlin Slack](https://slack.kotlinlang.org/) or ask a question with the `spring` and `kotlin` tags on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring+kotlin) if you need support.

#### 4.29.1. Requirements

Spring Boot supports Kotlin 1.3.x. To use Kotlin, `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib` and `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect` must be present on the classpath. The `kotlin-stdlib` variants `kotlin-stdlib-jdk7` and `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` can also be used.

Since [Kotlin classes are final by default](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/classes-final-by-default/166), you are likely to want to configure [kotlin-spring](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#spring-support) plugin in order to automatically open Spring-annotated classes so that they can be proxied.

[Jackson’s Kotlin module](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin) is required for serializing / deserializing JSON data in Kotlin. It is automatically registered when found on the classpath. A warning message is logged if Jackson and Kotlin are present but the Jackson Kotlin module is not.

|      | These dependencies and plugins are provided by default if one bootstraps a Kotlin project on [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.29.2. Null-safety

One of Kotlin’s key features is [null-safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html). It deals with `null` values at compile time rather than deferring the problem to runtime and encountering a `NullPointerException`. This helps to eliminate a common source of bugs without paying the cost of wrappers like `Optional`. Kotlin also allows using functional constructs with nullable values as described in this [comprehensive guide to null-safety in Kotlin](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin-null-safety).

Although Java does not allow one to express null-safety in its type system, Spring Framework, Spring Data, and Reactor now provide null-safety of their API via tooling-friendly annotations. By default, types from Java APIs used in Kotlin are recognized as [platform types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types) for which null-checks are relaxed. [Kotlin’s support for JSR 305 annotations](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#jsr-305-support) combined with nullability annotations provide null-safety for the related Spring API in Kotlin.

The JSR 305 checks can be configured by adding the `-Xjsr305` compiler flag with the following options: `-Xjsr305={strict|warn|ignore}`. The default behavior is the same as `-Xjsr305=warn`. The `strict` value is required to have null-safety taken in account in Kotlin types inferred from Spring API but should be used with the knowledge that Spring API nullability declaration could evolve even between minor releases and more checks may be added in the future).

|      | Generic type arguments, varargs and array elements nullability are not yet supported. See [SPR-15942](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15942) for up-to-date information. Also be aware that Spring Boot’s own API is [not yet annotated](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/10712). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.29.3. Kotlin API

##### runApplication

Spring Boot provides an idiomatic way to run an application with `runApplication(*args)` as shown in the following example:

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication

@SpringBootApplication
class MyApplication

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    runApplication<MyApplication>(*args)
}
```

This is a drop-in replacement for `SpringApplication.run(MyApplication::class.java, *args)`. It also allows customization of the application as shown in the following example:

```kotlin
runApplication<MyApplication>(*args) {
    setBannerMode(OFF)
}
```

##### Extensions

Kotlin [extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html) provide the ability to extend existing classes with additional functionality. The Spring Boot Kotlin API makes use of these extensions to add new Kotlin specific conveniences to existing APIs.

`TestRestTemplate` extensions, similar to those provided by Spring Framework for `RestOperations` in Spring Framework, are provided. Among other things, the extensions make it possible to take advantage of Kotlin reified type parameters.

#### 4.29.4. Dependency management

In order to avoid mixing different versions of Kotlin dependencies on the classpath, Spring Boot imports the Kotlin BOM.

With Maven, the Kotlin version can be customized via the `kotlin.version` property and plugin management is provided for `kotlin-maven-plugin`. With Gradle, the Spring Boot plugin automatically aligns the `kotlin.version` with the version of the Kotlin plugin.

Spring Boot also manages the version of Coroutines dependencies by importing the Kotlin Coroutines BOM. The version can be customized via the `kotlin-coroutines.version` property.

|      | `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactor` dependency is provided by default if one bootstraps a Kotlin project with at least one reactive dependency on [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.29.5. `@ConfigurationProperties`

`@ConfigurationProperties` when used in combination with [`@ConstructorBinding`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-constructor-binding) supports classes with immutable `val` properties as shown in the following example:

```kotlin
@ConstructorBinding
@ConfigurationProperties("example.kotlin")
data class KotlinExampleProperties(
        val name: String,
        val description: String,
        val myService: MyService) {

    data class MyService(
            val apiToken: String,
            val uri: URI
    )
}
```

|      | To generate [your own metadata](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-annotation-processor) using the annotation processor, [`kapt` should be configured](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html) with the `spring-boot-configuration-processor` dependency. Note that some features (such as detecting the default value or deprecated items) are not working due to limitations in the model kapt provides. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 4.29.6. Testing

While it is possible to use JUnit 4 to test Kotlin code, JUnit 5 is provided by default and is recommended. JUnit 5 enables a test class to be instantiated once and reused for all of the class’s tests. This makes it possible to use `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` annotations on non-static methods, which is a good fit for Kotlin.

JUnit 5 is the default and the vintage engine is provided for backward compatibility with JUnit 4. If you don’t use it, exclude `org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine`. You also need to [switch test instance lifecycle to "per-class"](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-instance-lifecycle-changing-default).

To mock Kotlin classes, [MockK](https://mockk.io/) is recommended. If you need the `Mockk` equivalent of the Mockito specific [`@MockBean` and `@SpyBean` annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-mocking-beans), you can use [SpringMockK](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/springmockk) which provides similar `@MockkBean` and `@SpykBean` annotations.

### 4.30. What to Read Next

If you want to learn more about any of the classes discussed in this section, you can check out the [Spring Boot API documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api/) or you can browse the [source code directly](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE). If you have specific questions, take a look at the [how-to](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto) section.

If you are comfortable with Spring Boot’s core features, you can continue on and read about [production-ready features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready).

## 5. Spring Boot Actuator: Production-ready Features

Spring Boot includes a number of additional features to help you monitor and manage your application when you push it to production. You can choose to manage and monitor your application by using HTTP endpoints or with JMX. Auditing, health, and metrics gathering can also be automatically applied to your application.

### 5.1. Enabling Production-ready Features

The [`spring-boot-actuator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator) module provides all of Spring Boot’s production-ready features. The recommended way to enable the features is to add a dependency on the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` ‘Starter’.

Definition of Actuator

An actuator is a manufacturing term that refers to a mechanical device for moving or controlling something. Actuators can generate a large amount of motion from a small change.

To add the actuator to a Maven based project, add the following ‘Starter’ dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

For Gradle, use the following declaration:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
}
```

### 5.2. Endpoints

Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot includes a number of built-in endpoints and lets you add your own. For example, the `health` endpoint provides basic application health information.

Each individual endpoint can be [enabled or disabled](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-enabling-endpoints) and [exposed (made remotely accessible) over HTTP or JMX](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints). An endpoint is considered to be available when it is both enabled and exposed. The built-in endpoints will only be auto-configured when they are available. Most applications choose exposure via HTTP, where the ID of the endpoint along with a prefix of `/actuator` is mapped to a URL. For example, by default, the `health` endpoint is mapped to `/actuator/health`.

The following technology-agnostic endpoints are available:

| ID                 | Description                                                  |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auditevents`      | Exposes audit events information for the current application. Requires an `AuditEventRepository` bean. |
| `beans`            | Displays a complete list of all the Spring beans in your application. |
| `caches`           | Exposes available caches.                                    |
| `conditions`       | Shows the conditions that were evaluated on configuration and auto-configuration classes and the reasons why they did or did not match. |
| `configprops`      | Displays a collated list of all `@ConfigurationProperties`.  |
| `env`              | Exposes properties from Spring’s `ConfigurableEnvironment`.  |
| `flyway`           | Shows any Flyway database migrations that have been applied. Requires one or more `Flyway` beans. |
| `health`           | Shows application health information.                        |
| `httptrace`        | Displays HTTP trace information (by default, the last 100 HTTP request-response exchanges). Requires an `HttpTraceRepository` bean. |
| `info`             | Displays arbitrary application info.                         |
| `integrationgraph` | Shows the Spring Integration graph. Requires a dependency on `spring-integration-core`. |
| `loggers`          | Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application. |
| `liquibase`        | Shows any Liquibase database migrations that have been applied. Requires one or more `Liquibase` beans. |
| `metrics`          | Shows ‘metrics’ information for the current application.     |
| `mappings`         | Displays a collated list of all `@RequestMapping` paths.     |
| `scheduledtasks`   | Displays the scheduled tasks in your application.            |
| `sessions`         | Allows retrieval and deletion of user sessions from a Spring Session-backed session store. Requires a Servlet-based web application using Spring Session. |
| `shutdown`         | Lets the application be gracefully shutdown. Disabled by default. |
| `threaddump`       | Performs a thread dump.                                      |

If your application is a web application (Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux, or Jersey), you can use the following additional endpoints:

| ID           | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `heapdump`   | Returns an `hprof` heap dump file.                           |
| `jolokia`    | Exposes JMX beans over HTTP (when Jolokia is on the classpath, not available for WebFlux). Requires a dependency on `jolokia-core`. |
| `logfile`    | Returns the contents of the logfile (if `logging.file.name` or `logging.file.path` properties have been set). Supports the use of the HTTP `Range` header to retrieve part of the log file’s content. |
| `prometheus` | Exposes metrics in a format that can be scraped by a Prometheus server. Requires a dependency on `micrometer-registry-prometheus`. |

To learn more about the Actuator’s endpoints and their request and response formats, please refer to the separate API documentation ([HTML](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/actuator-api//html/) or [PDF](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/actuator-api//pdf/spring-boot-actuator-web-api.pdf)).

#### 5.2.1. Enabling Endpoints

By default, all endpoints except for `shutdown` are enabled. To configure the enablement of an endpoint, use its `management.endpoint..enabled` property. The following example enables the `shutdown` endpoint:

```properties
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true
```

If you prefer endpoint enablement to be opt-in rather than opt-out, set the `management.endpoints.enabled-by-default` property to `false` and use individual endpoint `enabled` properties to opt back in. The following example enables the `info` endpoint and disables all other endpoints:

```properties
management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=false
management.endpoint.info.enabled=true
```

|      | Disabled endpoints are removed entirely from the application context. If you want to change only the technologies over which an endpoint is exposed, use the [`include` and `exclude` properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints) instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.2.2. Exposing Endpoints

Since Endpoints may contain sensitive information, careful consideration should be given about when to expose them. The following table shows the default exposure for the built-in endpoints:

| ID                 | JMX  | Web  |
| :----------------- | :--- | :--- |
| `auditevents`      | Yes  | No   |
| `beans`            | Yes  | No   |
| `caches`           | Yes  | No   |
| `conditions`       | Yes  | No   |
| `configprops`      | Yes  | No   |
| `env`              | Yes  | No   |
| `flyway`           | Yes  | No   |
| `health`           | Yes  | Yes  |
| `heapdump`         | N/A  | No   |
| `httptrace`        | Yes  | No   |
| `info`             | Yes  | Yes  |
| `integrationgraph` | Yes  | No   |
| `jolokia`          | N/A  | No   |
| `logfile`          | N/A  | No   |
| `loggers`          | Yes  | No   |
| `liquibase`        | Yes  | No   |
| `metrics`          | Yes  | No   |
| `mappings`         | Yes  | No   |
| `prometheus`       | N/A  | No   |
| `scheduledtasks`   | Yes  | No   |
| `sessions`         | Yes  | No   |
| `shutdown`         | Yes  | No   |
| `threaddump`       | Yes  | No   |

To change which endpoints are exposed, use the following technology-specific `include` and `exclude` properties:

| Property                                    | Default        |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------- |
| `management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude` |                |
| `management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include` | `*`            |
| `management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude` |                |
| `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` | `info, health` |

The `include` property lists the IDs of the endpoints that are exposed. The `exclude` property lists the IDs of the endpoints that should not be exposed. The `exclude` property takes precedence over the `include` property. Both `include` and `exclude` properties can be configured with a list of endpoint IDs.

For example, to stop exposing all endpoints over JMX and only expose the `health` and `info` endpoints, use the following property:

```properties
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=health,info
```

`*` can be used to select all endpoints. For example, to expose everything over HTTP except the `env` and `beans` endpoints, use the following properties:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=env,beans
```

|      | `*` has a special meaning in YAML, so be sure to add quotes if you want to include (or exclude) all endpoints, as shown in the following example:`management:  endpoints:    web:      exposure:        include: "*"` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If your application is exposed publicly, we strongly recommend that you also [secure your endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-security). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you want to implement your own strategy for when endpoints are exposed, you can register an `EndpointFilter` bean. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.2.3. Securing HTTP Endpoints

You should take care to secure HTTP endpoints in the same way that you would any other sensitive URL. If Spring Security is present, endpoints are secured by default using Spring Security’s content-negotiation strategy. If you wish to configure custom security for HTTP endpoints, for example, only allow users with a certain role to access them, Spring Boot provides some convenient `RequestMatcher` objects that can be used in combination with Spring Security.

A typical Spring Security configuration might look something like the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class ActuatorSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).authorizeRequests((requests) ->
                requests.anyRequest().hasRole("ENDPOINT_ADMIN"));
        http.httpBasic();
    }

}
```

The preceding example uses `EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()` to match a request to any endpoint and then ensures that all have the `ENDPOINT_ADMIN` role. Several other matcher methods are also available on `EndpointRequest`. See the API documentation ([HTML](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/actuator-api//html) or [PDF](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/actuator-api//pdf/spring-boot-actuator-web-api.pdf)) for details.

If you deploy applications behind a firewall, you may prefer that all your actuator endpoints can be accessed without requiring authentication. You can do so by changing the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` property, as follows:

application.properties

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

Additionally, if Spring Security is present, you would need to add custom security configuration that allows unauthenticated access to the endpoints as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class ActuatorSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).authorizeRequests((requests) ->
            requests.anyRequest().permitAll());
    }

}
```

#### 5.2.4. Configuring Endpoints

Endpoints automatically cache responses to read operations that do not take any parameters. To configure the amount of time for which an endpoint will cache a response, use its `cache.time-to-live` property. The following example sets the time-to-live of the `beans` endpoint’s cache to 10 seconds:

application.properties

```properties
management.endpoint.beans.cache.time-to-live=10s
```

|      | The prefix `management.endpoint.` is used to uniquely identify the endpoint that is being configured. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | When making an authenticated HTTP request, the `Principal` is considered as input to the endpoint and, therefore, the response will not be cached. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.2.5. Hypermedia for Actuator Web Endpoints

A “discovery page” is added with links to all the endpoints. The “discovery page” is available on `/actuator` by default.

When a custom management context path is configured, the “discovery page” automatically moves from `/actuator` to the root of the management context. For example, if the management context path is `/management`, then the discovery page is available from `/management`. When the management context path is set to `/`, the discovery page is disabled to prevent the possibility of a clash with other mappings.

#### 5.2.6. CORS Support

[Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS) is a [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) that lets you specify in a flexible way what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized. If you use Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux, Actuator’s web endpoints can be configured to support such scenarios.

CORS support is disabled by default and is only enabled once the `management.endpoints.web.cors.allowed-origins` property has been set. The following configuration permits `GET` and `POST` calls from the `example.com` domain:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.cors.allowed-origins=https://example.com
management.endpoints.web.cors.allowed-methods=GET,POST
```

|      | See [CorsEndpointProperties](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/endpoint/web/CorsEndpointProperties.java) for a complete list of options. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.2.7. Implementing Custom Endpoints

If you add a `@Bean` annotated with `@Endpoint`, any methods annotated with `@ReadOperation`, `@WriteOperation`, or `@DeleteOperation` are automatically exposed over JMX and, in a web application, over HTTP as well. Endpoints can be exposed over HTTP using Jersey, Spring MVC, or Spring WebFlux. If both Jersey and Spring MVC are available, Spring MVC will be used.

You can also write technology-specific endpoints by using `@JmxEndpoint` or `@WebEndpoint`. These endpoints are restricted to their respective technologies. For example, `@WebEndpoint` is exposed only over HTTP and not over JMX.

You can write technology-specific extensions by using `@EndpointWebExtension` and `@EndpointJmxExtension`. These annotations let you provide technology-specific operations to augment an existing endpoint.

Finally, if you need access to web-framework-specific functionality, you can implement Servlet or Spring `@Controller` and `@RestController` endpoints at the cost of them not being available over JMX or when using a different web framework.

##### Receiving Input

Operations on an endpoint receive input via their parameters. When exposed via the web, the values for these parameters are taken from the URL’s query parameters and from the JSON request body. When exposed via JMX, the parameters are mapped to the parameters of the MBean’s operations. Parameters are required by default. They can be made optional by annotating them with `@org.springframework.lang.Nullable`.

Each root property in the JSON request body can be mapped to a parameter of the endpoint. Consider the following JSON request body:

```json
{
    "name": "test",
    "counter": 42
}
```

This can be used to invoke a write operation that takes `String name` and `int counter` parameters.

|      | Because endpoints are technology agnostic, only simple types can be specified in the method signature. In particular declaring a single parameter with a custom type defining a `name` and `counter` properties is not supported. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | To allow the input to be mapped to the operation method’s parameters, Java code implementing an endpoint should be compiled with `-parameters`, and Kotlin code implementing an endpoint should be compiled with `-java-parameters`. This will happen automatically if you are using Spring Boot’s Gradle plugin or if you are using Maven and `spring-boot-starter-parent`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Input type conversion

The parameters passed to endpoint operation methods are, if necessary, automatically converted to the required type. Before calling an operation method, the input received via JMX or an HTTP request is converted to the required types using an instance of `ApplicationConversionService` as well as any `Converter` or `GenericConverter` beans qualified with `@EndpointConverter`.

##### Custom Web Endpoints

Operations on an `@Endpoint`, `@WebEndpoint`, or `@EndpointWebExtension` are automatically exposed over HTTP using Jersey, Spring MVC, or Spring WebFlux. If both Jersey and Spring MVC are available, Spring MVC will be used.

###### Web Endpoint Request Predicates

A request predicate is automatically generated for each operation on a web-exposed endpoint.

###### Path

The path of the predicate is determined by the ID of the endpoint and the base path of web-exposed endpoints. The default base path is `/actuator`. For example, an endpoint with the ID `sessions` will use `/actuator/sessions` as its path in the predicate.

The path can be further customized by annotating one or more parameters of the operation method with `@Selector`. Such a parameter is added to the path predicate as a path variable. The variable’s value is passed into the operation method when the endpoint operation is invoked. If you want to capture all remaining path elements, you can add `@Selector(Match=ALL_REMAINING)` to the last parameter and make it a type that is conversion compatible with a `String[]`.

###### HTTP method

The HTTP method of the predicate is determined by the operation type, as shown in the following table:

| Operation          | HTTP method |
| :----------------- | :---------- |
| `@ReadOperation`   | `GET`       |
| `@WriteOperation`  | `POST`      |
| `@DeleteOperation` | `DELETE`    |

###### Consumes

For a `@WriteOperation` (HTTP `POST`) that uses the request body, the consumes clause of the predicate is `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json, application/json`. For all other operations the consumes clause is empty.

###### Produces

The produces clause of the predicate can be determined by the `produces` attribute of the `@DeleteOperation`, `@ReadOperation`, and `@WriteOperation` annotations. The attribute is optional. If it is not used, the produces clause is determined automatically.

If the operation method returns `void` or `Void` the produces clause is empty. If the operation method returns a `org.springframework.core.io.Resource`, the produces clause is `application/octet-stream`. For all other operations the produces clause is `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json, application/json`.

###### Web Endpoint Response Status

The default response status for an endpoint operation depends on the operation type (read, write, or delete) and what, if anything, the operation returns.

A `@ReadOperation` returns a value, the response status will be 200 (OK). If it does not return a value, the response status will be 404 (Not Found).

If a `@WriteOperation` or `@DeleteOperation` returns a value, the response status will be 200 (OK). If it does not return a value the response status will be 204 (No Content).

If an operation is invoked without a required parameter, or with a parameter that cannot be converted to the required type, the operation method will not be called and the response status will be 400 (Bad Request).

###### Web Endpoint Range Requests

An HTTP range request can be used to request part of an HTTP resource. When using Spring MVC or Spring Web Flux, operations that return a `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` automatically support range requests.

|      | Range requests are not supported when using Jersey. |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- |
|      |                                                     |

###### Web Endpoint Security

An operation on a web endpoint or a web-specific endpoint extension can receive the current `java.security.Principal` or `org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.SecurityContext` as a method parameter. The former is typically used in conjunction with `@Nullable` to provide different behavior for authenticated and unauthenticated users. The latter is typically used to perform authorization checks using its `isUserInRole(String)` method.

##### Servlet endpoints

A `Servlet` can be exposed as an endpoint by implementing a class annotated with `@ServletEndpoint` that also implements `Supplier`. Servlet endpoints provide deeper integration with the Servlet container but at the expense of portability. They are intended to be used to expose an existing `Servlet` as an endpoint. For new endpoints, the `@Endpoint` and `@WebEndpoint` annotations should be preferred whenever possible.

##### Controller endpoints

`@ControllerEndpoint` and `@RestControllerEndpoint` can be used to implement an endpoint that is only exposed by Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux. Methods are mapped using the standard annotations for Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux such as `@RequestMapping` and `@GetMapping`, with the endpoint’s ID being used as a prefix for the path. Controller endpoints provide deeper integration with Spring’s web frameworks but at the expense of portability. The `@Endpoint` and `@WebEndpoint` annotations should be preferred whenever possible.

#### 5.2.8. Health Information

You can use health information to check the status of your running application. It is often used by monitoring software to alert someone when a production system goes down. The information exposed by the `health` endpoint depends on the `management.endpoint.health.show-details` and `management.endpoint.health.show-components` properties which can be configured with one of the following values:

| Name              | Description                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `never`           | Details are never shown.                                     |
| `when-authorized` | Details are only shown to authorized users. Authorized roles can be configured using `management.endpoint.health.roles`. |
| `always`          | Details are shown to all users.                              |

The default value is `never`. A user is considered to be authorized when they are in one or more of the endpoint’s roles. If the endpoint has no configured roles (the default) all authenticated users are considered to be authorized. The roles can be configured using the `management.endpoint.health.roles` property.

|      | If you have secured your application and wish to use `always`, your security configuration must permit access to the health endpoint for both authenticated and unauthenticated users. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Health information is collected from the content of a [`HealthContributorRegistry`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthContributorRegistry.java) (by default all [`HealthContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthContributor.java) instances defined in your `ApplicationContext`). Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured `HealthContributors` and you can also write your own.

A `HealthContributor` can either be a `HealthIndicator` or a `CompositeHealthContributor`. A `HealthIndicator` provides actual health information, including a `Status`. A `CompositeHealthContributor` provides a composite of other `HealthContributors`. Taken together, contributors form a tree structure to represent the overall system health.

By default, the final system health is derived by a `StatusAggregator` which sorts the statuses from each `HealthIndicator` based on an ordered list of statuses. The first status in the sorted list is used as the overall health status. If no `HealthIndicator` returns a status that is known to the `StatusAggregator`, an `UNKNOWN` status is used.

|      | The `HealthContributorRegistry` can be used to register and unregister health indicators at runtime. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Auto-configured HealthIndicators

|      | You can disable them all by setting the `management.health.defaults.enabled` property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Writing Custom HealthIndicators

To provide custom health information, you can register Spring beans that implement the [`HealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthIndicator.java) interface. You need to provide an implementation of the `health()` method and return a `Health` response. The `Health` response should include a status and can optionally include additional details to be displayed. The following code shows a sample `HealthIndicator` implementation:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.Health;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        int errorCode = check(); // perform some specific health check
        if (errorCode != 0) {
            return Health.down().withDetail("Error Code", errorCode).build();
        }
        return Health.up().build();
    }

}
```

|      | The identifier for a given `HealthIndicator` is the name of the bean without the `HealthIndicator` suffix, if it exists. In the preceding example, the health information is available in an entry named `my`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

In addition to Spring Boot’s predefined [`Status`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/Status.java) types, it is also possible for `Health` to return a custom `Status` that represents a new system state. In such cases, a custom implementation of the [`StatusAggregator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/StatusAggregator.java) interface also needs to be provided, or the default implementation has to be configured by using the `management.endpoint.health.status.order` configuration property.

For example, assume a new `Status` with code `FATAL` is being used in one of your `HealthIndicator` implementations. To configure the severity order, add the following property to your application properties:

```properties
management.endpoint.health.status.order=fatal,down,out-of-service,unknown,up
```

The HTTP status code in the response reflects the overall health status. By default, `OUT_OF_SERVICE` and `DOWN` map to 503. Any unmapped health statuses, including `UP`, map to 200. You might also want to register custom status mappings if you access the health endpoint over HTTP. Configuring a custom mapping disables the defaults mappings for `DOWN` and `OUT_OF_SERVICE`. If you want to retain the default mappings they must be configured explicitly alongside any custom mappings. For example, the following property maps `FATAL` to 503 (service unavailable) and retains the default mappings for `DOWN` and `OUT_OF_SERVICE`:

```properties
management.endpoint.health.status.http-mapping.down=503
management.endpoint.health.status.http-mapping.fatal=503
management.endpoint.health.status.http-mapping.out-of-service=503
```

|      | If you need more control, you can define your own `HttpCodeStatusMapper` bean. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following table shows the default status mappings for the built-in statuses:

| Status         | Mapping                                      |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| DOWN           | SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)                    |
| OUT_OF_SERVICE | SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)                    |
| UP             | No mapping by default, so http status is 200 |
| UNKNOWN        | No mapping by default, so http status is 200 |

##### Reactive Health Indicators

For reactive applications, such as those using Spring WebFlux, `ReactiveHealthContributor` provides a non-blocking contract for getting application health. Similar to a traditional `HealthContributor`, health information is collected from the content of a [`ReactiveHealthContributorRegistry`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/ReactiveHealthContributorRegistry.java) (by default all [`HealthContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthContributor.java) and [`ReactiveHealthContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/ReactiveHealthContributor.java) instances defined in your `ApplicationContext`). Regular `HealthContributors` that do not check against a reactive API are executed on the elastic scheduler.

|      | In a reactive application, The `ReactiveHealthContributorRegistry` should be used to register and unregister health indicators at runtime. If you need to register a regular `HealthContributor`, you should wrap it using `ReactiveHealthContributor#adapt`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To provide custom health information from a reactive API, you can register Spring beans that implement the [`ReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/ReactiveHealthIndicator.java) interface. The following code shows a sample `ReactiveHealthIndicator` implementation:

```java
@Component
public class MyReactiveHealthIndicator implements ReactiveHealthIndicator {

    @Override
    public Mono<Health> health() {
        return doHealthCheck() //perform some specific health check that returns a Mono<Health>
            .onErrorResume(ex -> Mono.just(new Health.Builder().down(ex).build()));
    }

}
```

|      | To handle the error automatically, consider extending from `AbstractReactiveHealthIndicator`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Auto-configured ReactiveHealthIndicators

The following `ReactiveHealthIndicators` are auto-configured by Spring Boot when appropriate:

| Name                                                         | Description                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| [`CassandraReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/cassandra/CassandraReactiveHealthIndicator.java) | Checks that a Cassandra database is up. |
| [`CouchbaseReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/couchbase/CouchbaseReactiveHealthIndicator.java) | Checks that a Couchbase cluster is up.  |
| [`MongoReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/mongo/MongoReactiveHealthIndicator.java) | Checks that a Mongo database is up.     |
| [`RedisReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/redis/RedisReactiveHealthIndicator.java) | Checks that a Redis server is up.       |

|      | If necessary, reactive indicators replace the regular ones. Also, any `HealthIndicator` that is not handled explicitly is wrapped automatically. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Health Groups

It’s sometimes useful to organize health indicators into groups that can be used for different purposes. For example, if you deploy your application to Kubernetes, you may want one different sets of health indicators for your “liveness” and “readiness” probes.

To create a health indicator group you can use the `management.endpoint.health.group.` property and specify a list of health indicator IDs to `include` or `exclude`. For example, to create a group that includes only database indicators you can define the following:

```properties
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.include=db
```

You can then check the result by hitting `localhost:8080/actuator/health/custom`.

By default groups will inherit the same `StatusAggregator` and `HttpCodeStatusMapper` settings as the system health, however, these can also be defined on a per-group basis. It’s also possible to override the `show-details` and `roles` properties if required:

```properties
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-details=when-authorized
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.roles=admin
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.status.order=fatal,up
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.status.http-mapping.fatal=500
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.status.http-mapping.out-of-service=500
```

|      | You can use `@Qualifier("groupname")` if you need to register custom `StatusAggregator` or `HttpCodeStatusMapper` beans for use with the group. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.2.9. Application Information

Application information exposes various information collected from all [`InfoContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/InfoContributor.java) beans defined in your `ApplicationContext`. Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured `InfoContributor` beans, and you can write your own.

##### Auto-configured InfoContributors

The following `InfoContributor` beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot, when appropriate:

| Name                                                         | Description                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`EnvironmentInfoContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/EnvironmentInfoContributor.java) | Exposes any key from the `Environment` under the `info` key. |
| [`GitInfoContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/GitInfoContributor.java) | Exposes git information if a `git.properties` file is available. |
| [`BuildInfoContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/BuildInfoContributor.java) | Exposes build information if a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is available. |

|      | It is possible to disable them all by setting the `management.info.defaults.enabled` property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Custom Application Information

You can customize the data exposed by the `info` endpoint by setting `info.*` Spring properties. All `Environment` properties under the `info` key are automatically exposed. For example, you could add the following settings to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
info.app.encoding=UTF-8
info.app.java.source=1.8
info.app.java.target=1.8
```

|      | Rather than hardcoding those values, you could also [expand info properties at build time](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-automatic-expansion).Assuming you use Maven, you could rewrite the preceding example as follows:`info.app.encoding=@project.build.sourceEncoding@ info.app.java.source=@java.version@ info.app.java.target=@java.version@` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Git Commit Information

Another useful feature of the `info` endpoint is its ability to publish information about the state of your `git` source code repository when the project was built. If a `GitProperties` bean is available, the `git.branch`, `git.commit.id`, and `git.commit.time` properties are exposed.

|      | A `GitProperties` bean is auto-configured if a `git.properties` file is available at the root of the classpath. See "[Generate git information](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-git-info)" for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you want to display the full git information (that is, the full content of `git.properties`), use the `management.info.git.mode` property, as follows:

```properties
management.info.git.mode=full
```

##### Build Information

If a `BuildProperties` bean is available, the `info` endpoint can also publish information about your build. This happens if a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is available in the classpath.

|      | The Maven and Gradle plugins can both generate that file. See "[Generate build information](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-build-info)" for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Writing Custom InfoContributors

To provide custom application information, you can register Spring beans that implement the [`InfoContributor`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/InfoContributor.java) interface.

The following example contributes an `example` entry with a single value:

```java
import java.util.Collections;

import org.springframework.boot.actuate.info.Info;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.info.InfoContributor;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ExampleInfoContributor implements InfoContributor {

    @Override
    public void contribute(Info.Builder builder) {
        builder.withDetail("example",
                Collections.singletonMap("key", "value"));
    }

}
```

If you reach the `info` endpoint, you should see a response that contains the following additional entry:

```json
{
    "example": {
        "key" : "value"
    }
}
```

### 5.3. Monitoring and Management over HTTP

If you are developing a web application, Spring Boot Actuator auto-configures all enabled endpoints to be exposed over HTTP. The default convention is to use the `id` of the endpoint with a prefix of `/actuator` as the URL path. For example, `health` is exposed as `/actuator/health`.

|      | Actuator is supported natively with Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux, and Jersey. If both Jersey and Spring MVC are available, Spring MVC will be used. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Jackson is a required dependency in order to get the correct JSON responses as documented in the API documentation ([HTML](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/actuator-api//html) or [PDF](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/actuator-api//pdf/spring-boot-actuator-web-api.pdf)). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.3.1. Customizing the Management Endpoint Paths

Sometimes, it is useful to customize the prefix for the management endpoints. For example, your application might already use `/actuator` for another purpose. You can use the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property to change the prefix for your management endpoint, as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/manage
```

The preceding `application.properties` example changes the endpoint from `/actuator/{id}` to `/manage/{id}` (for example, `/manage/info`).

|      | Unless the management port has been configured to [expose endpoints by using a different HTTP port](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-customizing-management-server-port), `management.endpoints.web.base-path` is relative to `server.servlet.context-path`. If `management.server.port` is configured, `management.endpoints.web.base-path` is relative to `management.server.servlet.context-path`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you want to map endpoints to a different path, you can use the `management.endpoints.web.path-mapping` property.

The following example remaps `/actuator/health` to `/healthcheck`:

application.properties

```properties
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/
management.endpoints.web.path-mapping.health=healthcheck
```

#### 5.3.2. Customizing the Management Server Port

Exposing management endpoints by using the default HTTP port is a sensible choice for cloud-based deployments. If, however, your application runs inside your own data center, you may prefer to expose endpoints by using a different HTTP port.

You can set the `management.server.port` property to change the HTTP port, as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.server.port=8081
```

|      | On Cloud Foundry, applications only receive requests on port 8080 for both HTTP and TCP routing, by default. If you want to use a custom management port on Cloud Foundry, you will need to explicitly set up the application’s routes to forward traffic to the custom port. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.3.3. Configuring Management-specific SSL

When configured to use a custom port, the management server can also be configured with its own SSL by using the various `management.server.ssl.*` properties. For example, doing so lets a management server be available over HTTP while the main application uses HTTPS, as shown in the following property settings:

```properties
server.port=8443
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:store.jks
server.ssl.key-password=secret
management.server.port=8080
management.server.ssl.enabled=false
```

Alternatively, both the main server and the management server can use SSL but with different key stores, as follows:

```properties
server.port=8443
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:main.jks
server.ssl.key-password=secret
management.server.port=8080
management.server.ssl.enabled=true
management.server.ssl.key-store=classpath:management.jks
management.server.ssl.key-password=secret
```

#### 5.3.4. Customizing the Management Server Address

You can customize the address that the management endpoints are available on by setting the `management.server.address` property. Doing so can be useful if you want to listen only on an internal or ops-facing network or to listen only for connections from `localhost`.

|      | You can listen on a different address only when the port differs from the main server port. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following example `application.properties` does not allow remote management connections:

```properties
management.server.port=8081
management.server.address=127.0.0.1
```

#### 5.3.5. Disabling HTTP Endpoints

If you do not want to expose endpoints over HTTP, you can set the management port to `-1`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.server.port=-1
```

This can be achieved using the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude` property as well, as shown in following example:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*
```

### 5.4. Monitoring and Management over JMX

Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage applications. By default, this feature is not enabled and can be turned on by setting the configuration property `spring.jmx.enabled` to `true`. Spring Boot exposes management endpoints as JMX MBeans under the `org.springframework.boot` domain by default.

#### 5.4.1. Customizing MBean Names

The name of the MBean is usually generated from the `id` of the endpoint. For example, the `health` endpoint is exposed as `org.springframework.boot:type=Endpoint,name=Health`.

If your application contains more than one Spring `ApplicationContext`, you may find that names clash. To solve this problem, you can set the `spring.jmx.unique-names` property to `true` so that MBean names are always unique.

You can also customize the JMX domain under which endpoints are exposed. The following settings show an example of doing so in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.jmx.unique-names=true
management.endpoints.jmx.domain=com.example.myapp
```

#### 5.4.2. Disabling JMX Endpoints

If you do not want to expose endpoints over JMX, you can set the `management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude` property to `*`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude=*
```

#### 5.4.3. Using Jolokia for JMX over HTTP

Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge that provides an alternative method of accessing JMX beans. To use Jolokia, include a dependency to `org.jolokia:jolokia-core`. For example, with Maven, you would add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
    <artifactId>jolokia-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The Jolokia endpoint can then be exposed by adding `jolokia` or `*` to the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` property. You can then access it by using `/actuator/jolokia` on your management HTTP server.

|      | The Jolokia endpoint exposes Jolokia’s servlet as an actuator endpoint. As a result, it is specific to servlet environments such as Spring MVC and Jersey. The endpoint will not be available in a WebFlux application. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Customizing Jolokia

Jolokia has a number of settings that you would traditionally configure by setting servlet parameters. With Spring Boot, you can use your `application.properties` file. To do so, prefix the parameter with `management.endpoint.jolokia.config.`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.endpoint.jolokia.config.debug=true
```

##### Disabling Jolokia

If you use Jolokia but do not want Spring Boot to configure it, set the `management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled` property to `false`, as follows:

```properties
management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled=false
```

### 5.5. Loggers

Spring Boot Actuator includes the ability to view and configure the log levels of your application at runtime. You can view either the entire list or an individual logger’s configuration, which is made up of both the explicitly configured logging level as well as the effective logging level given to it by the logging framework. These levels can be one of:

- `TRACE`
- `DEBUG`
- `INFO`
- `WARN`
- `ERROR`
- `FATAL`
- `OFF`
- `null`

`null` indicates that there is no explicit configuration.

#### 5.5.1. Configure a Logger

To configure a given logger, `POST` a partial entity to the resource’s URI, as shown in the following example:

```json
{
    "configuredLevel": "DEBUG"
}
```

|      | To “reset” the specific level of the logger (and use the default configuration instead), you can pass a value of `null` as the `configuredLevel`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 5.6. Metrics

|      | To learn more about Micrometer’s capabilities, please refer to its [reference documentation](https://micrometer.io/docs), in particular the [concepts section](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.6.1. Getting started

Spring Boot auto-configures a composite `MeterRegistry` and adds a registry to the composite for each of the supported implementations that it finds on the classpath. Having a dependency on `micrometer-registry-{system}` in your runtime classpath is enough for Spring Boot to configure the registry.

Most registries share common features. For instance, you can disable a particular registry even if the Micrometer registry implementation is on the classpath. For example, to disable Datadog:

```properties
management.metrics.export.datadog.enabled=false
```

Spring Boot will also add any auto-configured registries to the global static composite registry on the `Metrics` class unless you explicitly tell it not to:

```properties
management.metrics.use-global-registry=false
```

You can register any number of `MeterRegistryCustomizer` beans to further configure the registry, such as applying common tags, before any meters are registered with the registry:

```java
@Bean
MeterRegistryCustomizer<MeterRegistry> metricsCommonTags() {
    return registry -> registry.config().commonTags("region", "us-east-1");
}
```

You can apply customizations to particular registry implementations by being more specific about the generic type:

```java
@Bean
MeterRegistryCustomizer<GraphiteMeterRegistry> graphiteMetricsNamingConvention() {
    return registry -> registry.config().namingConvention(MY_CUSTOM_CONVENTION);
}
```

With that setup in place you can inject `MeterRegistry` in your components and register metrics:

```java
@Component
public class SampleBean {

    private final Counter counter;

    public SampleBean(MeterRegistry registry) {
        this.counter = registry.counter("received.messages");
    }

    public void handleMessage(String message) {
        this.counter.increment();
        // handle message implementation
    }

}
```

Spring Boot also [configures built-in instrumentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics-meter) (i.e. `MeterBinder` implementations) that you can control via configuration or dedicated annotation markers.

#### 5.6.2. Supported monitoring systems

```

Micrometer provides a default `HierarchicalNameMapper` that governs how a dimensional meter id is [mapped to flat hierarchical names](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/graphite#_hierarchical_name_mapping).

|      | To take control over this behaviour, define your `GraphiteMeterRegistry` and supply your own `HierarchicalNameMapper`. An auto-configured `GraphiteConfig` and `Clock` beans are provided unless you define your own: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

    return new GraphiteMeterRegistry(config, clock, MY_HIERARCHICAL_MAPPER);
}
```

##### Humio

By default, the Humio registry pushes metrics to [cloud.humio.com](https://cloud.humio.com/) periodically. To export metrics to SaaS [Humio](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/humio), your API token must be provided:

```properties
management.metrics.export.humio.api-token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

You should also configure one or more tags to identify the data source to which metrics will be pushed:

```properties
management.metrics.export.humio.tags.alpha=a
management.metrics.export.humio.tags.bravo=b
```

##### Influx

By default, metrics are exported to [Influx](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/influx) running on your local machine. The location of the [Influx server](https://www.influxdata.com/) to use can be provided using:

```properties
management.metrics.export.influx.uri=https://influx.example.com:8086
```

##### JMX

Micrometer provides a hierarchical mapping to [JMX](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/jmx), primarily as a cheap and portable way to view metrics locally. By default, metrics are exported to the `metrics` JMX domain. The domain to use can be provided using:

```properties
management.metrics.export.jmx.domain=com.example.app.metrics
```

Micrometer provides a default `HierarchicalNameMapper` that governs how a dimensional meter id is [mapped to flat hierarchical names](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/jmx#_hierarchical_name_mapping).

|      | To take control over this behaviour, define your `JmxMeterRegistry` and supply your own `HierarchicalNameMapper`. An auto-configured `JmxConfig` and `Clock` beans are provided unless you define your own: |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

```java
@Bean
public JmxMeterRegistry jmxMeterRegistry(JmxConfig config, Clock clock) {
    return new JmxMeterRegistry(config, clock, MY_HIERARCHICAL_MAPPER);
}
```

##### KairosDB

By default, metrics are exported to [KairosDB](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/kairos) running on your local machine. The location of the [KairosDB server](https://kairosdb.github.io/) to use can be provided using:

```properties
management.metrics.export.kairos.uri=https://kairosdb.example.com:8080/api/v1/datapoints
```

##### New Relic

New Relic registry pushes metrics to [New Relic](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/new-relic) periodically. To export metrics to [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), your API key and account id must be provided:

```properties
management.metrics.export.newrelic.api-key=YOUR_KEY
management.metrics.export.newrelic.account-id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```

You can also change the interval at which metrics are sent to New Relic:

```properties
management.metrics.export.newrelic.step=30s
```

##### Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/prometheus) expects to scrape or poll individual app instances for metrics. Spring Boot provides an actuator endpoint available at `/actuator/prometheus` to present a [Prometheus scrape](https://prometheus.io/) with the appropriate format.

|      | The endpoint is not available by default and must be exposed, see [exposing endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Here is an example `scrape_config` to add to `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HOST:PORT']
```

For ephemeral or batch jobs which may not exist long enough to be scraped, [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) support can be used to expose their metrics to Prometheus. To enable Prometheus Pushgateway support, add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId>
    <artifactId>simpleclient_pushgateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

When the Prometheus Pushgateway dependency is present on the classpath, Spring Boot auto-configures a `PrometheusPushGatewayManager` bean. This manages the pushing of metrics to a Prometheus Pushgateway. The `PrometheusPushGatewayManager` can be tuned using properties under `management.metrics.export.prometheus.pushgateway`. For advanced configuration, you can also provide your own `PrometheusPushGatewayManager` bean.

##### SignalFx

SignalFx registry pushes metrics to [SignalFx](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/signalfx) periodically. To export metrics to [SignalFx](https://www.signalfx.com/), your access token must be provided:

```properties
management.metrics.export.signalfx.access-token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

You can also change the interval at which metrics are sent to SignalFx:

```properties
management.metrics.export.signalfx.step=30s
```

##### Simple

Micrometer ships with a simple, in-memory backend that is automatically used as a fallback if no other registry is configured. This allows you to see what metrics are collected in the [metrics endpoint](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics-endpoint).

The in-memory backend disables itself as soon as you’re using any of the other available backend. You can also disable it explicitly:

```properties
management.metrics.export.simple.enabled=false
```

##### StatsD

The StatsD registry pushes metrics over UDP to a StatsD agent eagerly. By default, metrics are exported to a [StatsD](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/statsd) agent running on your local machine. The StatsD agent host and port to use can be provided using:

```properties
management.metrics.export.statsd.host=statsd.example.com
management.metrics.export.statsd.port=9125
```

You can also change the StatsD line protocol to use (default to Datadog):

```properties
management.metrics.export.statsd.flavor=etsy
```

##### Wavefront

Wavefront registry pushes metrics to [Wavefront](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/wavefront) periodically. If you are exporting metrics to [Wavefront](https://www.wavefront.com/) directly, your API token must be provided:

```properties
management.metrics.export.wavefront.api-token=YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Alternatively, you may use a Wavefront sidecar or an internal proxy set up in your environment that forwards metrics data to the Wavefront API host:

```properties
management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=proxy://localhost:2878
```

|      | If publishing metrics to a Wavefront proxy (as described in [the documentation](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_installing.html)), the host must be in the `proxy://HOST:PORT` format. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can also change the interval at which metrics are sent to Wavefront:

```properties
management.metrics.export.wavefront.step=30s
```

#### 5.6.3. Supported Metrics

Spring Boot registers the following core metrics when applicable:

- JVM metrics, report utilization of:
  - Various memory and buffer pools
  - Statistics related to garbage collection
  - Threads utilization
  - Number of classes loaded/unloaded
- CPU metrics

##### Spring MVC Metrics

Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC. When `management.metrics.web.server.request.autotime.enabled` is `true`, this instrumentation occurs for all requests. Alternatively, when set to `false`, you can enable instrumentation by adding `@Timed` to a request-handling method:

```java
@RestController
@Timed 
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/api/people")
    @Timed(extraTags = { "region", "us-east-1" }) 
    @Timed(value = "all.people", longTask = true) 
    public List<Person> listPeople() { ... }

}
```

|      | A controller class to enable timings on every request handler in the controller. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | A method to enable for an individual endpoint. This is not necessary if you have it on the class, but can be used to further customize the timer for this particular endpoint. |
|      | A method with `longTask = true` to enable a long task timer for the method. Long task timers require a separate metric name, and can be stacked with a short task timer. |

By default, metrics are generated with the name, `http.server.requests`. The name can be customized by setting the `management.metrics.web.server.request.metric-name` property.

By default, Spring MVC-related metrics are tagged with the following information:

| Tag         | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exception` | Simple class name of any exception that was thrown while handling the request. |
| `method`    | Request’s method (for example, `GET` or `POST`)              |
| `outcome`   | Request’s outcome based on the status code of the response. 1xx is `INFORMATIONAL`, 2xx is `SUCCESS`, 3xx is `REDIRECTION`, 4xx `CLIENT_ERROR`, and 5xx is `SERVER_ERROR` |
| `status`    | Response’s HTTP status code (for example, `200` or `500`)    |
| `uri`       | Request’s URI template prior to variable substitution, if possible (for example, `/api/person/{id}`) |

To customize the tags, provide a `@Bean` that implements `WebMvcTagsProvider`.

##### Spring WebFlux Metrics

Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all requests handled by WebFlux controllers and functional handlers.

By default, metrics are generated with the name `http.server.requests`. You can customize the name by setting the `management.metrics.web.server.request.metric-name` property.

By default, WebFlux-related metrics are tagged with the following information:

| Tag         | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exception` | Simple class name of any exception that was thrown while handling the request. |
| `method`    | Request’s method (for example, `GET` or `POST`)              |
| `outcome`   | Request’s outcome based on the status code of the response. 1xx is `INFORMATIONAL`, 2xx is `SUCCESS`, 3xx is `REDIRECTION`, 4xx `CLIENT_ERROR`, and 5xx is `SERVER_ERROR` |
| `status`    | Response’s HTTP status code (for example, `200` or `500`)    |
| `uri`       | Request’s URI template prior to variable substitution, if possible (for example, `/api/person/{id}`) |

To customize the tags, provide a `@Bean` that implements `WebFluxTagsProvider`.

##### Jersey Server Metrics

When Micrometer’s `micrometer-jersey2` module is on the classpath, auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by the Jersey JAX-RS implementation. When `management.metrics.web.server.request.autotime.enabled` is `true`, this instrumentation occurs for all requests. Alternatively, when set to `false`, you can enable instrumentation by adding `@Timed` to a request-handling method:

```java
@Component
@Path("/api/people")
@Timed 
public class Endpoint {
    @GET
    @Timed(extraTags = { "region", "us-east-1" }) 
    @Timed(value = "all.people", longTask = true) 
    public List<Person> listPeople() { ... }
}
```

|      | On a resource class to enable timings on every request handler in the resource. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | On a method to enable for an individual endpoint. This is not necessary if you have it on the class, but can be used to further customize the timer for this particular endpoint. |
|      | On a method with `longTask = true` to enable a long task timer for the method. Long task timers require a separate metric name, and can be stacked with a short task timer. |

By default, metrics are generated with the name, `http.server.requests`. The name can be customized by setting the `management.metrics.web.server.request.metric-name` property.

By default, Jersey server metrics are tagged with the following information:

| Tag         | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exception` | Simple class name of any exception that was thrown while handling the request. |
| `method`    | Request’s method (for example, `GET` or `POST`)              |
| `outcome`   | Request’s outcome based on the status code of the response. 1xx is `INFORMATIONAL`, 2xx is `SUCCESS`, 3xx is `REDIRECTION`, 4xx `CLIENT_ERROR`, and 5xx is `SERVER_ERROR` |
| `status`    | Response’s HTTP status code (for example, `200` or `500`)    |
| `uri`       | Request’s URI template prior to variable substitution, if possible (for example, `/api/person/{id}`) |

To customize the tags, provide a `@Bean` that implements `JerseyTagsProvider`.

##### HTTP Client Metrics

Spring Boot Actuator manages the instrumentation of both `RestTemplate` and `WebClient`. For that, you have to get injected with an auto-configured builder and use it to create instances:

- `RestTemplateBuilder` for `RestTemplate`
- `WebClient.Builder` for `WebClient`

It is also possible to apply manually the customizers responsible for this instrumentation, namely `MetricsRestTemplateCustomizer` and `MetricsWebClientCustomizer`.

By default, metrics are generated with the name, `http.client.requests`. The name can be customized by setting the `management.metrics.web.client.request.metric-name` property.

By default, metrics generated by an instrumented client are tagged with the following information:

| Tag          | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clientName` | Host portion of the URI                                      |
| `method`     | Request’s method (for example, `GET` or `POST`)              |
| `outcome`    | Request’s outcome based on the status code of the response. 1xx is `INFORMATIONAL`, 2xx is `SUCCESS`, 3xx is `REDIRECTION`, 4xx `CLIENT_ERROR`, and 5xx is `SERVER_ERROR`, `UNKNOWN` otherwise |
| `status`     | Response’s HTTP status code if available (for example, `200` or `500`), or `IO_ERROR` in case of I/O issues, `CLIENT_ERROR` otherwise |
| `uri`        | Request’s URI template prior to variable substitution, if possible (for example, `/api/person/{id}`) |

To customize the tags, and depending on your choice of client, you can provide a `@Bean` that implements `RestTemplateExchangeTagsProvider` or `WebClientExchangeTagsProvider`. There are convenience static functions in `RestTemplateExchangeTags` and `WebClientExchangeTags`.

##### Cache Metrics

Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all available `Cache`s on startup with metrics prefixed with `cache`. Cache instrumentation is standardized for a basic set of metrics. Additional, cache-specific metrics are also available.

The following cache libraries are supported:

- Caffeine
- EhCache 2
- Hazelcast
- Any compliant JCache (JSR-107) implementation

Metrics are tagged by the name of the cache and by the name of the `CacheManager` that is derived from the bean name.

|      | Only caches that are configured on startup are bound to the registry. For caches not defined in the cache’s configuration, e.g. caches created on-the-fly or programmatically after the startup phase, an explicit registration is required. A `CacheMetricsRegistrar` bean is made available to make that process easier. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### DataSource Metrics

Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all available `DataSource` objects with metrics prefixed with `jdbc.connections`. Data source instrumentation results in gauges representing the currently active, idle, maximum allowed, and minimum allowed connections in the pool.

Metrics are also tagged by the name of the `DataSource` computed based on the bean name.

|      | By default, Spring Boot provides metadata for all supported data sources; you can add additional `DataSourcePoolMetadataProvider` beans if your favorite data source isn’t supported out of the box. See `DataSourcePoolMetadataProvidersConfiguration` for examples. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Also, Hikari-specific metrics are exposed with a `hikaricp` prefix. Each metric is tagged by the name of the Pool (can be controlled with `spring.datasource.name`).

##### Hibernate Metrics

Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all available Hibernate `EntityManagerFactory` instances that have statistics enabled with a metric named `hibernate`.

Metrics are also tagged by the name of the `EntityManagerFactory` that is derived from the bean name.

To enable statistics, the standard JPA property `hibernate.generate_statistics` must be set to `true`. You can enable that on the auto-configured `EntityManagerFactory` as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=true
```

##### RabbitMQ Metrics

Auto-configuration will enable the instrumentation of all available RabbitMQ connection factories with a metric named `rabbitmq`.

#### 5.6.4. Registering custom metrics

To register custom metrics, inject `MeterRegistry` into your component, as shown in the following example:

```java
class Dictionary {

    private final List<String> words = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

    Dictionary(MeterRegistry registry) {
        registry.gaugeCollectionSize("dictionary.size", Tags.empty(), this.words);
    }

    // …

}
```

If you find that you repeatedly instrument a suite of metrics across components or applications, you may encapsulate this suite in a `MeterBinder` implementation. By default, metrics from all `MeterBinder` beans will be automatically bound to the Spring-managed `MeterRegistry`.

#### 5.6.5. Customizing individual metrics

If you need to apply customizations to specific `Meter` instances you can use the `io.micrometer.core.instrument.config.MeterFilter` interface. By default, all `MeterFilter` beans will be automatically applied to the micrometer `MeterRegistry.Config`.

For example, if you want to rename the `mytag.region` tag to `mytag.area` for all meter IDs beginning with `com.example`, you can do the following:

```java
@Bean
public MeterFilter renameRegionTagMeterFilter() {
    return MeterFilter.renameTag("com.example", "mytag.region", "mytag.area");
}
```

##### Common tags

Common tags are generally used for dimensional drill-down on the operating environment like host, instance, region, stack, etc. Commons tags are applied to all meters and can be configured as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.metrics.tags.region=us-east-1
management.metrics.tags.stack=prod
```

The example above adds `region` and `stack` tags to all meters with a value of `us-east-1` and `prod` respectively.

|      | The order of common tags is important if you are using Graphite. As the order of common tags cannot be guaranteed using this approach, Graphite users are advised to define a custom `MeterFilter` instead. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Per-meter properties

In addition to `MeterFilter` beans, it’s also possible to apply a limited set of customization on a per-meter basis using properties. Per-meter customizations apply to any all meter IDs that start with the given name. For example, the following will disable any meters that have an ID starting with `example.remote`

```properties
management.metrics.enable.example.remote=false
```

The following properties allow per-meter customization:

| Property                                                     | Description                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `management.metrics.enable`                                  | Whether to deny meters from emitting any metrics.            |
| `management.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram`      | Whether to publish a histogram suitable for computing aggregable (across dimension) percentile approximations. |
| `management.metrics.distribution.minimum-expected-value`, `management.metrics.distribution.maximum-expected-value` | Publish less histogram buckets by clamping the range of expected values. |
| `management.metrics.distribution.percentiles`                | Publish percentile values computed in your application       |
| `management.metrics.distribution.sla`                        | Publish a cumulative histogram with buckets defined by your SLAs. |

For more details on concepts behind `percentiles-histogram`, `percentiles` and `sla` refer to the ["Histograms and percentiles" section](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_histograms_and_percentiles) of the micrometer documentation.

#### 5.6.6. Metrics endpoint

Spring Boot provides a `metrics` endpoint that can be used diagnostically to examine the metrics collected by an application. The endpoint is not available by default and must be exposed, see [exposing endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints) for more details.

Navigating to `/actuator/metrics` displays a list of available meter names. You can drill down to view information about a particular meter by providing its name as a selector, e.g. `/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max`.

|      | The name you use here should match the name used in the code, not the name after it has been naming-convention normalized for a monitoring system it is shipped to. In other words, if `jvm.memory.max` appears as `jvm_memory_max` in Prometheus because of its snake case naming convention, you should still use `jvm.memory.max` as the selector when inspecting the meter in the `metrics` endpoint. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can also add any number of `tag=KEY:VALUE` query parameters to the end of the URL to dimensionally drill down on a meter, e.g. `/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max?tag=area:nonheap`.

|      | The reported measurements are the *sum* of the statistics of all meters matching the meter name and any tags that have been applied. So in the example above, the returned "Value" statistic is the sum of the maximum memory footprints of "Code Cache", "Compressed Class Space", and "Metaspace" areas of the heap. If you only wanted to see the maximum size for the "Metaspace", you could add an additional `tag=id:Metaspace`, i.e. `/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max?tag=area:nonheap&tag=id:Metaspace`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 5.7. Auditing

Once Spring Security is in play, Spring Boot Actuator has a flexible audit framework that publishes events (by default, “authentication success”, “failure” and “access denied” exceptions). This feature can be very useful for reporting and for implementing a lock-out policy based on authentication failures.

Auditing can be enabled by providing a bean of type `AuditEventRepository` in your application’s configuration. For convenience, Spring Boot offers an `InMemoryAuditEventRepository`. `InMemoryAuditEventRepository` has limited capabilities and we recommend using it only for development environments. For production environments, consider creating your own alternative `AuditEventRepository` implementation.

#### 5.7.1. Custom Auditing

To customize published security events, you can provide your own implementations of `AbstractAuthenticationAuditListener` and `AbstractAuthorizationAuditListener`.

You can also use the audit services for your own business events. To do so, either inject the `AuditEventRepository` bean into your own components and use that directly or publish an `AuditApplicationEvent` with the Spring `ApplicationEventPublisher` (by implementing `ApplicationEventPublisherAware`).

### 5.8. HTTP Tracing

HTTP Tracing can be enabled by providing a bean of type `HttpTraceRepository` in your application’s configuration. For convenience, Spring Boot offers an `InMemoryHttpTraceRepository` that stores traces for the last 100 request-response exchanges, by default. `InMemoryHttpTraceRepository` is limited compared to other tracing solutions and we recommend using it only for development environments. For production environments, use of a production-ready tracing or observability solution, such as Zipkin or Spring Cloud Sleuth, is recommended. Alternatively, create your own `HttpTraceRepository` that meets your needs.

The `httptrace` endpoint can be used to obtain information about the request-response exchanges that are stored in the `HttpTraceRepository`.

#### 5.8.1. Custom HTTP tracing

To customize the items that are included in each trace, use the `management.trace.http.include` configuration property. For advanced customization, consider registering your own `HttpExchangeTracer` implementation.

### 5.9. Process Monitoring

In the `spring-boot` module, you can find two classes to create files that are often useful for process monitoring:

- `ApplicationPidFileWriter` creates a file containing the application PID (by default, in the application directory with a file name of `application.pid`).
- `WebServerPortFileWriter` creates a file (or files) containing the ports of the running web server (by default, in the application directory with a file name of `application.port`).

By default, these writers are not activated, but you can enable:

- [By Extending Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-process-monitoring-configuration)
- [Programmatically](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-process-monitoring-programmatically)

#### 5.9.1. Extending Configuration

In the `META-INF/spring.factories` file, you can activate the listener(s) that writes a PID file, as shown in the following example:

```
org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener=\
org.springframework.boot.context.ApplicationPidFileWriter,\
org.springframework.boot.web.context.WebServerPortFileWriter
```

#### 5.9.2. Programmatically

You can also activate a listener by invoking the `SpringApplication.addListeners(…)` method and passing the appropriate `Writer` object. This method also lets you customize the file name and path in the `Writer` constructor.

### 5.10. Cloud Foundry Support

Spring Boot’s actuator module includes additional support that is activated when you deploy to a compatible Cloud Foundry instance. The `/cloudfoundryapplication` path provides an alternative secured route to all `@Endpoint` beans.

The extended support lets Cloud Foundry management UIs (such as the web application that you can use to view deployed applications) be augmented with Spring Boot actuator information. For example, an application status page may include full health information instead of the typical “running” or “stopped” status.

|      | The `/cloudfoundryapplication` path is not directly accessible to regular users. In order to use the endpoint, a valid UAA token must be passed with the request. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 5.10.1. Disabling Extended Cloud Foundry Actuator Support

If you want to fully disable the `/cloudfoundryapplication` endpoints, you can add the following setting to your `application.properties` file:

application.properties

```properties
management.cloudfoundry.enabled=false
```

#### 5.10.2. Cloud Foundry Self-signed Certificates

By default, the security verification for `/cloudfoundryapplication` endpoints makes SSL calls to various Cloud Foundry services. If your Cloud Foundry UAA or Cloud Controller services use self-signed certificates, you need to set the following property:

application.properties

```properties
management.cloudfoundry.skip-ssl-validation=true
```

#### 5.10.3. Custom context path

If the server’s context-path has been configured to anything other than `/`, the Cloud Foundry endpoints will not be available at the root of the application. For example, if `server.servlet.context-path=/app`, Cloud Foundry endpoints will be available at `/app/cloudfoundryapplication/*`.

If you expect the Cloud Foundry endpoints to always be available at `/cloudfoundryapplication/*`, regardless of the server’s context-path, you will need to explicitly configure that in your application. The configuration will differ depending on the web server in use. For Tomcat, the following configuration can be added:

```java
@Bean
public TomcatServletWebServerFactory servletWebServerFactory() {
    return new TomcatServletWebServerFactory() {

        @Override
        protected void prepareContext(Host host, ServletContextInitializer[] initializers) {
            super.prepareContext(host, initializers);
            StandardContext child = new StandardContext();
            child.addLifecycleListener(new Tomcat.FixContextListener());
            child.setPath("/cloudfoundryapplication");
            ServletContainerInitializer initializer = getServletContextInitializer(getContextPath());
            child.addServletContainerInitializer(initializer, Collections.emptySet());
            child.setCrossContext(true);
            host.addChild(child);
        }

    };
}

private ServletContainerInitializer getServletContextInitializer(String contextPath) {
    return (c, context) -> {
        Servlet servlet = new GenericServlet() {

            @Override
            public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
                ServletContext context = req.getServletContext().getContext(contextPath);
                context.getRequestDispatcher("/cloudfoundryapplication").forward(req, res);
            }

        };
        context.addServlet("cloudfoundry", servlet).addMapping("/*");
    };
}
```

### 5.11. What to Read Next

You might want to read about graphing tools such as [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/).

Otherwise, you can continue on, to read about [‘deployment options’](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment) or jump ahead for some in-depth information about Spring Boot’s *[build tool plugins](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins)*.

## 6. Deploying Spring Boot Applications

Spring Boot’s flexible packaging options provide a great deal of choice when it comes to deploying your application. You can deploy Spring Boot applications to a variety of cloud platforms, to container images (such as Docker), or to virtual/real machines.

This section covers some of the more common deployment scenarios.

### 6.1. Deploying to Containers

If you are running your application from a container, you can use an executable jar, but it is also often an advantage to explode it and run it in a different way. Certain PaaS implementations may also choose to unpack archives before they run. For example, Cloud Foundry operates this way. The simplest way to run an unpacked archive is by starting the appropriate launcher, as follows:

```
$ jar -xf myapp.jar
$ java org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
```

This is actually slightly faster on startup (depending on the size of the jar) than running from an unexploded archive. At runtime you shouldn’t expect any differences.

Once you have unpacked the jar file, you can also get an extra boost to startup time by running the app with its "natural" main method instead of the `JarLauncher`. For example:

```
$ jar -xf myapp.jar
$ java -cp BOOT-INF/classes:BOOT-INF/lib/* com.example.MyApplication
```

More efficient container images can also be created by copying the dependencies to the image as a separate layer from the application classes and resources (which normally change more frequently). There is more than one way to achieve this layer separation. For example, using a `Dockerfile` you could express it in this form:

```
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR target/dependency
ARG APPJAR=target/*.jar
COPY ${APPJAR} app.jar
RUN jar -xf ./app.jar

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
ARG DEPENDENCY=target/dependency
COPY --from=builder ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
COPY --from=builder ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
COPY --from=builder ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","app:app/lib/*","com.example.MyApplication"]
```

Assuming the above `Dockerfile` is in the current directory, your docker image can be built with `docker build .`, or optionally specifying the path to your application jar, as shown in the following example:

```
docker build --build-arg APPJAR=path/to/myapp.jar .
```

### 6.2. Deploying to the Cloud

Spring Boot’s executable jars are ready-made for most popular cloud PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) providers. These providers tend to require that you “bring your own container”. They manage application processes (not Java applications specifically), so they need an intermediary layer that adapts *your* application to the *cloud’s* notion of a running process.

Two popular cloud providers, Heroku and Cloud Foundry, employ a “buildpack” approach. The buildpack wraps your deployed code in whatever is needed to *start* your application. It might be a JDK and a call to `java`, an embedded web server, or a full-fledged application server. A buildpack is pluggable, but ideally you should be able to get by with as few customizations to it as possible. This reduces the footprint of functionality that is not under your control. It minimizes divergence between development and production environments.

Ideally, your application, like a Spring Boot executable jar, has everything that it needs to run packaged within it.

In this section, we look at what it takes to get the [application that we developed](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application) in the “Getting Started” section up and running in the Cloud.

#### 6.2.1. Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry provides default buildpacks that come into play if no other buildpack is specified. The Cloud Foundry [Java buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) has excellent support for Spring applications, including Spring Boot. You can deploy stand-alone executable jar applications as well as traditional `.war` packaged applications.

Once you have built your application (by using, for example, `mvn clean package`) and have [installed the `cf` command line tool](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html), deploy your application by using the `cf push` command, substituting the path to your compiled `.jar`. Be sure to have [logged in with your `cf` command line client](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) before pushing an application. The following line shows using the `cf push` command to deploy an application:

```
$ cf push acloudyspringtime -p target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

|      | In the preceding example, we substitute `acloudyspringtime` for whatever value you give `cf` as the name of your application. |

|      |                                                              |

See the [`cf push` documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html#push) for more options. If there is a Cloud Foundry [`manifest.yml`](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) file present in the same directory, it is considered.

At this point, `cf` starts uploading your application, producing output similar to the following example:

```

```

Congratulations! The application is now live!

Once your application is live, you can verify the status of the deployed application by using the `cf apps` command, as shown in the following example:

```
$ cf apps
Getting applications in ...
OK

name                 requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
...
acloudyspringtime    started           1/1         512M     1G     acloudyspringtime.cfapps.io
...
```

Once Cloud Foundry acknowledges that your application has been deployed, you should be able to find the application at the URI given. In the preceding example, you could find it at `https://acloudyspringtime.cfapps.io/`.

##### Binding to Services

By default, metadata about the running application as well as service connection information is exposed to the application as environment variables (for example: `$VCAP_SERVICES`). This architecture decision is due to Cloud Foundry’s polyglot (any language and platform can be supported as a buildpack) nature. Process-scoped environment variables are language agnostic.

Environment variables do not always make for the easiest API, so Spring Boot automatically extracts them and flattens the data into properties that can be accessed through Spring’s `Environment` abstraction, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
class MyBean implements EnvironmentAware {

    private String instanceId;

    @Override
    public void setEnvironment(Environment environment) {
        this.instanceId = environment.getProperty("vcap.application.instance_id");
    }

    // ...

}
```

All Cloud Foundry properties are prefixed with `vcap`. You can use `vcap` properties to access application information (such as the public URL of the application) and service information (such as database credentials). See the [‘CloudFoundryVcapEnvironmentPostProcessor’](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/cloud/CloudFoundryVcapEnvironmentPostProcessor.html) Javadoc for complete details.

|      |                                                              |

#### 6.2.2. Heroku

Heroku is another popular PaaS platform. To customize Heroku builds, you provide a `Procfile`, which provides the incantation required to deploy an application. Heroku assigns a `port` for the Java application to use and then ensures that routing to the external URI works.

You must configure your application to listen on the correct port. The following example shows the `Procfile` for our starter REST application:

```
web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Spring Boot makes `-D` arguments available as properties accessible from a Spring `Environment` instance. The `server.port` configuration property is fed to the embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow instance, which then uses the port when it starts up. The `$PORT` environment variable is assigned to us by the Heroku PaaS.

This should be everything you need. The most common deployment workflow for Heroku deployments is to `git push` the code to production, as shown in the following example:

```
$ git push heroku master

#### 6.2.3. OpenShift

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is the Red Hat public (and enterprise) extension of the Kubernetes container orchestration platform. Similarly to Kubernetes, OpenShift has many options for installing Spring Boot based applications.

OpenShift has many resources describing how to deploy Spring Boot applications, including:

- [Using the S2I builder](https://blog.openshift.com/using-openshift-enterprise-grade-spring-boot-deployments/)
- [Architecture guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/reference_architectures/2017/html-single/spring_boot_microservices_on_red_hat_openshift_container_platform_3/)
- [Running as a traditional web application on Wildfly](https://blog.openshift.com/using-spring-boot-on-openshift/)
- [OpenShift Commons Briefing](https://blog.openshift.com/openshift-commons-briefing-96-cloud-native-applications-spring-rhoar/)

#### 6.2.4. Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services offers multiple ways to install Spring Boot-based applications, either as traditional web applications (war) or as executable jar files with an embedded web server. The options include:

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS Code Deploy
- AWS OPS Works
- AWS Cloud Formation
- AWS Container Registry

Each has different features and pricing models. In this document, we describe to approach using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

##### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

As described in the official [Elastic Beanstalk Java guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_Java.html), there are two main options to deploy a Java application. You can either use the “Tomcat Platform” or the “Java SE platform”.

###### Using the Tomcat Platform

This option applies to Spring Boot projects that produce a war file. No special configuration is required. You need only follow the official guide.

###### Using the Java SE Platform

This option applies to Spring Boot projects that produce a jar file and run an embedded web container. Elastic Beanstalk environments run an nginx instance on port 80 to proxy the actual application, running on port 5000. To configure it, add the following line to your `application.properties` file:

```
server.port=5000
```

|      | Upload binaries instead of sourcesBy default, Elastic Beanstalk uploads sources and compiles them in AWS. However, it is best to upload the binaries instead. To do so, add lines similar to the following to your `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` file:`deploy:    artifact: target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Reduce costs by setting the environment typeBy default an Elastic Beanstalk environment is load balanced. The load balancer has a significant cost. To avoid that cost, set the environment type to “Single instance”, as described in [the Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environments-create-wizard.html#environments-create-wizard-capacity). You can also create single instance environments by using the CLI and the following command:`eb create -s` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Summary

This is one of the easiest ways to get to AWS, but there are more things to cover, such as how to integrate Elastic Beanstalk into any CI / CD tool, use the Elastic Beanstalk Maven plugin instead of the CLI, and others. There is a [blog post](https://exampledriven.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/spring-boot-aws-elastic-beanstalk-example/) covering these topics more in detail.

#### 6.2.5. Boxfuse and Amazon Web Services

[Boxfuse](https://boxfuse.com/) works by turning your Spring Boot executable jar or war into a minimal VM image that can be deployed unchanged either on VirtualBox or on AWS. Boxfuse comes with deep integration for Spring Boot and uses the information from your Spring Boot configuration file to automatically configure ports and health check URLs. Boxfuse leverages this information both for the images it produces as well as for all the resources it provisions (instances, security groups, elastic load balancers, and so on).

Once you have created a [Boxfuse account](https://console.boxfuse.com/), connected it to your AWS account, installed the latest version of the Boxfuse Client, and ensured that the application has been built by Maven or Gradle (by using, for example, `mvn clean package`), you can deploy your Spring Boot application to AWS with a command similar to the following:

```
$ boxfuse run myapp-1.0.jar -env=prod
```

See the [`boxfuse run` documentation](https://boxfuse.com/docs/commandline/run.html) for more options. If there is a [`boxfuse.conf`](https://boxfuse.com/docs/commandline/#configuration) file present in the current directory, it is considered.

|      | By default, Boxfuse activates a Spring profile named `boxfuse` on startup. If your executable jar or war contains an [`application-boxfuse.properties`](https://boxfuse.com/docs/payloads/springboot.html#configuration) file, Boxfuse bases its configuration on the properties it contains. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

At this point, `boxfuse` creates an image for your application, uploads it, and configures and starts the necessary resources on AWS, resulting in output similar to the following example:

```
Fusing Image for myapp-1.0.jar ...
Image fused in 00:06.838s (53937 K) -> axelfontaine/myapp:1.0
Creating axelfontaine/myapp ...

Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
Deployment completed successfully. axelfontaine/myapp:1.0 is up and running at https://myapp-axelfontaine.boxfuse.io/
```

Your application should now be up and running on AWS.

See the blog post on [deploying Spring Boot apps on EC2](https://boxfuse.com/blog/spring-boot-ec2.html) as well as the [documentation for the Boxfuse Spring Boot integration](https://boxfuse.com/docs/payloads/springboot.html) to get started with a Maven build to run the app.

#### 6.2.6. Google Cloud

Google Cloud has several options that can be used to launch Spring Boot applications. The easiest to get started with is probably App Engine, but you could also find ways to run Spring Boot in a container with Container Engine or on a virtual machine with Compute Engine.

To run in App Engine, you can create a project in the UI first, which sets up a unique identifier for you and also sets up HTTP routes. Add a Java app to the project and leave it empty and then use the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) to push your Spring Boot app into that slot from the command line or CI build.

App Engine Standard requires you to use WAR packaging. Follow [these steps](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/getting-started-java/blob/master/appengine-standard-java8/springboot-appengine-standard/README.md) to deploy App Engine Standard application to Google Cloud.

Alternatively, App Engine Flex requires you to create an `app.yaml` file to describe the resources your app requires. Normally, you put this file in `src/main/appengine`, and it should resemble the following file:

```yaml
service: default

runtime: java
env: flex

runtime_config:
  jdk: openjdk8

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: this field is required, but ignored

manual_scaling:
  instances: 1

health_check:
  enable_health_check: False

env_variables:
  ENCRYPT_KEY: your_encryption_key_here
```

You can deploy the app (for example, with a Maven plugin) by adding the project ID to the build configuration, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <project>myproject</project>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Then deploy with `mvn appengine:deploy` (if you need to authenticate first, the build fails).

### 6.3. Installing Spring Boot Applications

In addition to running Spring Boot applications by using `java -jar`, it is also possible to make fully executable applications for Unix systems. A fully executable jar can be executed like any other executable binary or it can be [registered with `init.d` or `systemd`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-service). This helps when installing and managing Spring Boot applications in common production environments.

|      | Fully executable jars work by embedding an extra script at the front of the file. Currently, some tools do not accept this format, so you may not always be able to use this technique. For example, `jar -xf` may silently fail to extract a jar or war that has been made fully executable. It is recommended that you make your jar or war fully executable only if you intend to execute it directly, rather than running it with `java -jar` or deploying it to a servlet container. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | A zip64-format jar file cannot be made fully executable. Attempting to do so will result in a jar file that is reported as corrupt when executed directly or with `java -jar`. A standard-format jar file that contains one or more zip64-format nested jars can be fully executable. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To create a ‘fully executable’ jar with Maven, use the following plugin configuration:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <executable>true</executable>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

The following example shows the equivalent Gradle configuration:

```groovy
bootJar {
    launchScript()
}
```

You can then run your application by typing `./my-application.jar` (where `my-application` is the name of your artifact). The directory containing the jar is used as your application’s working directory.

#### 6.3.1. Supported Operating Systems

The default script supports most Linux distributions and is tested on CentOS and Ubuntu. Other platforms, such as OS X and FreeBSD, require the use of a custom `embeddedLaunchScript`.

#### 6.3.2. Unix/Linux Services

Spring Boot application can be easily started as Unix/Linux services by using either `init.d` or `systemd`.

##### Installation as an `init.d` Service (System V)

If you configured Spring Boot’s Maven or Gradle plugin to generate a [fully executable jar](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-install), and you do not use a custom `embeddedLaunchScript`, your application can be used as an `init.d` service. To do so, symlink the jar to `init.d` to support the standard `start`, `stop`, `restart`, and `status` commands.

The script supports the following features:

- Starts the services as the user that owns the jar file
- Tracks the application’s PID by using `/var/run//.pid`
- Writes console logs to `/var/log/.log`

Assuming that you have a Spring Boot application installed in `/var/myapp`, to install a Spring Boot application as an `init.d` service, create a symlink, as follows:

```
$ sudo ln -s /var/myapp/myapp.jar /etc/init.d/myapp
```

Once installed, you can start and stop the service in the usual way. For example, on a Debian-based system, you could start it with the following command:

```
$ service myapp start
```

|      | If your application fails to start, check the log file written to `/var/log/.log` for errors. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can also flag the application to start automatically by using your standard operating system tools. For example, on Debian, you could use the following command:

```
$ update-rc.d myapp defaults <priority>
```

###### Securing an `init.d` Service

|      | The following is a set of guidelines on how to secure a Spring Boot application that runs as an init.d service. It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of everything that should be done to harden an application and the environment in which it runs. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

When executed as root, as is the case when root is being used to start an init.d service, the default executable script runs the application as the user specified in the `RUN_AS_USER` environment variable. When the environment variable is not set, the user who owns the jar file is used instead. You should never run a Spring Boot application as `root`, so `RUN_AS_USER` should never be root and your application’s jar file should never be owned by root. Instead, create a specific user to run your application and set the `RUN_AS_USER` environment variable or use `chown` to make it the owner of the jar file, as shown in the following example:

```
$ chown bootapp:bootapp your-app.jar
```

In this case, the default executable script runs the application as the `bootapp` user.

|      | To reduce the chances of the application’s user account being compromised, you should consider preventing it from using a login shell. For example, you can set the account’s shell to `/usr/sbin/nologin`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You should also take steps to prevent the modification of your application’s jar file. Firstly, configure its permissions so that it cannot be written and can only be read or executed by its owner, as shown in the following example:

```
$ chmod 500 your-app.jar
```

Second, you should also take steps to limit the damage if your application or the account that’s running it is compromised. If an attacker does gain access, they could make the jar file writable and change its contents. One way to protect against this is to make it immutable by using `chattr`, as shown in the following example:

```
$ sudo chattr +i your-app.jar
```

This will prevent any user, including root, from modifying the jar.

If root is used to control the application’s service and you [use a `.conf` file](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-script-customization-conf-file) to customize its startup, the `.conf` file is read and evaluated by the root user. It should be secured accordingly. Use `chmod` so that the file can only be read by the owner and use `chown` to make root the owner, as shown in the following example:

```
$ chmod 400 your-app.conf
$ sudo chown root:root your-app.conf
```

##### Installation as a `systemd` Service

`systemd` is the successor of the System V init system and is now being used by many modern Linux distributions. Although you can continue to use `init.d` scripts with `systemd`, it is also possible to launch Spring Boot applications by using `systemd` ‘service’ scripts.

Assuming that you have a Spring Boot application installed in `/var/myapp`, to install a Spring Boot application as a `systemd` service, create a script named `myapp.service` and place it in `/etc/systemd/system` directory. The following script offers an example:

```
[Unit]
Description=myapp
After=syslog.target

[Service]
User=myapp
ExecStart=/var/myapp/myapp.jar
SuccessExitStatus=143

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

|      | Remember to change the `Description`, `User`, and `ExecStart` fields for your application. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | The `ExecStart` field does not declare the script action command, which means that the `run` command is used by default. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Note that, unlike when running as an `init.d` service, the user that runs the application, the PID file, and the console log file are managed by `systemd` itself and therefore must be configured by using appropriate fields in the ‘service’ script. Consult the [service unit configuration man page](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) for more details.

To flag the application to start automatically on system boot, use the following command:

```
$ systemctl enable myapp.service
```

Refer to `man systemctl` for more details.

##### Customizing the Startup Script

The default embedded startup script written by the Maven or Gradle plugin can be customized in a number of ways. For most people, using the default script along with a few customizations is usually enough. If you find you cannot customize something that you need to, use the `embeddedLaunchScript` option to write your own file entirely.

###### Customizing the Start Script when It Is Written

It often makes sense to customize elements of the start script as it is written into the jar file. For example, init.d scripts can provide a “description”. Since you know the description up front (and it need not change), you may as well provide it when the jar is generated.

To customize written elements, use the `embeddedLaunchScriptProperties` option of the Spring Boot Maven plugin or the [`properties` property of the Spring Boot Gradle plugin’s `launchScript`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html//#packaging-executable-configuring-launch-script).

The following property substitutions are supported with the default script:

| `stopWaitTime`             | Default value for `STOP_WAIT_TIME` in seconds. Only valid for an `init.d` service | 60                                                           | 60                                                           |

###### Customizing a Script When It Runs

For items of the script that need to be customized *after* the jar has been written, you can use environment variables or a [config file](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-script-customization-conf-file).

The following environment properties are supported with the default script:

| Variable                | Description                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MODE`                  | The “mode” of operation. The default depends on the way the jar was built but is usually `auto` (meaning it tries to guess if it is an init script by checking if it is a symlink in a directory called `init.d`). You can explicitly set it to `service` so that the `stop|start|status|restart` commands work or to `run` if you want to run the script in the foreground. |
| `RUN_AS_USER`           | The user that will be used to run the application. When not set, the user that owns the jar file will be used. |
| `USE_START_STOP_DAEMON` | Whether the `start-stop-daemon` command, when it’s available, should be used to control the process. Defaults to `true`. |
| `PID_FOLDER`            | The root name of the pid folder (`/var/run` by default).     |
| `LOG_FOLDER`            | The name of the folder in which to put log files (`/var/log` by default). |
| `CONF_FOLDER`           | The name of the folder from which to read .conf files (same folder as jar-file by default). |
| `LOG_FILENAME`          | The name of the log file in the `LOG_FOLDER` (`.log` by default). |
| `APP_NAME`              | The name of the app. If the jar is run from a symlink, the script guesses the app name. If it is not a symlink or you want to explicitly set the app name, this can be useful. |
| `RUN_ARGS`              | The arguments to pass to the program (the Spring Boot app).  |
| `JAVA_HOME`             | The location of the `java` executable is discovered by using the `PATH` by default, but you can set it explicitly if there is an executable file at `$JAVA_HOME/bin/java`. |
| `JAVA_OPTS`             | Options that are passed to the JVM when it is launched.      |
| `JARFILE`               | The explicit location of the jar file, in case the script is being used to launch a jar that it is not actually embedded. |
| `DEBUG`                 | If not empty, sets the `-x` flag on the shell process, allowing you to see the logic in the script. |
| `STOP_WAIT_TIME`        | The time in seconds to wait when stopping the application before forcing a shutdown (`60` by default). |

|      | The `PID_FOLDER`, `LOG_FOLDER`, and `LOG_FILENAME` variables are only valid for an `init.d` service. For `systemd`, the equivalent customizations are made by using the ‘service’ script. See the [service unit configuration man page](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

With the exception of `JARFILE` and `APP_NAME`, the settings listed in the preceding section can be configured by using a `.conf` file. The file is expected to be next to the jar file and have the same name but suffixed with `.conf` rather than `.jar`. For example, a jar named `/var/myapp/myapp.jar` uses the configuration file named `/var/myapp/myapp.conf`, as shown in the following example:

myapp.conf

```
JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx1024M
LOG_FOLDER=/custom/log/folder
```

|      | If you do not like having the config file next to the jar file, you can set a `CONF_FOLDER` environment variable to customize the location of the config file. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To learn about securing this file appropriately, see [the guidelines for securing an init.d service](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-initd-service-securing).

#### 6.3.3. Microsoft Windows Services

A Spring Boot application can be started as a Windows service by using [`winsw`](https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw).

A ([separately maintained sample](https://github.com/snicoll-scratches/spring-boot-daemon)) describes step-by-step how you can create a Windows service for your Spring Boot application.

### 6.4. What to Read Next

Check out the [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), and [Boxfuse](https://boxfuse.com/) web sites for more information about the kinds of features that a PaaS can offer. These are just four of the most popular Java PaaS providers. Since Spring Boot is so amenable to cloud-based deployment, you can freely consider other providers as well.

The next section goes on to cover the *[Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#cli)*, or you can jump ahead to read about *[build tool plugins](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins)*.

## 7. Spring Boot CLI

The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that you can use if you want to quickly develop a Spring application. It lets you run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax without so much boilerplate code. You can also bootstrap a new project or write your own command for it.

### 7.1. Installing the CLI

The Spring Boot CLI (Command-Line Interface) can be installed manually by using SDKMAN! (the SDK Manager) or by using Homebrew or MacPorts if you are an OSX user. See *[Installing the Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli)* in the “Getting started” section for comprehensive installation instructions.

### 7.2. Using the CLI

Once you have installed the CLI, you can run it by typing `spring` and pressing Enter at the command line. If you run `spring` without any arguments, a help screen is displayed, as follows:

```
$ spring
usage: spring [--help] [--version]
       <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:

  run [options] <files> [--] [args]
    Run a spring groovy script

  ... more command help is shown here
```

You can type `spring help` to get more details about any of the supported commands, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring help run
spring run - Run a spring groovy script

usage: spring run [options] <files> [--] [args]

Option                     Description
------                     -----------
--autoconfigure [Boolean]  Add autoconfigure compiler
                             transformations (default: true)
--classpath, -cp           Additional classpath entries
--no-guess-dependencies    Do not attempt to guess dependencies
--no-guess-imports         Do not attempt to guess imports
-q, --quiet                Quiet logging
-v, --verbose              Verbose logging of dependency
                             resolution
--watch                    Watch the specified file for changes
```

The `version` command provides a quick way to check which version of Spring Boot you are using, as follows:

```
$ spring version
Spring CLI v2.2.9.RELEASE
```

#### 7.2.1. Running Applications with the CLI

You can compile and run Groovy source code by using the `run` command. The Spring Boot CLI is completely self-contained, so you do not need any external Groovy installation.

The following example shows a “hello world” web application written in Groovy:

hello.groovy

```groovy
@RestController
class WebApplication {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    String home() {
        "Hello World!"
    }

}
```

To compile and run the application, type the following command:

```
$ spring run hello.groovy
```

To pass command-line arguments to the application, use `--` to separate the commands from the “spring” command arguments, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring run hello.groovy -- --server.port=9000
```

To set JVM command line arguments, you can use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable, as shown in the following example:

```
$ JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx1024m spring run hello.groovy
```

|      | When setting `JAVA_OPTS` on Microsoft Windows, make sure to quote the entire instruction, such as `set "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx2048m"`. Doing so ensures the values are properly passed to the process. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Deduced “grab” Dependencies

Standard Groovy includes a `@Grab` annotation, which lets you declare dependencies on third-party libraries. This useful technique lets Groovy download jars in the same way as Maven or Gradle would but without requiring you to use a build tool.

Spring Boot extends this technique further and tries to deduce which libraries to “grab” based on your code. For example, since the `WebApplication` code shown previously uses `@RestController` annotations, Spring Boot grabs "Tomcat" and "Spring MVC".

The following items are used as “grab hints”:

| Items                                                      | Grabs                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `JdbcTemplate`, `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`, `DataSource` | JDBC Application.              |
| `@EnableJms`                                               | JMS Application.               |
| `@EnableCaching`                                           | Caching abstraction.           |
| `@Test`                                                    | JUnit.                         |
| `@EnableRabbit`                                            | RabbitMQ.                      |
| extends `Specification`                                    | Spock test.                    |
| `@EnableBatchProcessing`                                   | Spring Batch.                  |
| `@MessageEndpoint` `@EnableIntegration`                    | Spring Integration.            |
| `@Controller` `@RestController` `@EnableWebMvc`            | Spring MVC + Embedded Tomcat.  |
| `@EnableWebSecurity`                                       | Spring Security.               |
| `@EnableTransactionManagement`                             | Spring Transaction Management. |

|      | See subclasses of [`CompilerAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-cli/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/cli/compiler/CompilerAutoConfiguration.java) in the Spring Boot CLI source code to understand exactly how customizations are applied. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Deduced “grab” Coordinates

Spring Boot extends Groovy’s standard `@Grab` support by letting you specify a dependency without a group or version (for example, `@Grab('freemarker')`). Doing so consults Spring Boot’s default dependency metadata to deduce the artifact’s group and version.

|      | The default metadata is tied to the version of the CLI that you use. It changes only when you move to a new version of the CLI, putting you in control of when the versions of your dependencies may change. A table showing the dependencies and their versions that are included in the default metadata can be found in the [appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#dependency-versions). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Default Import Statements

To help reduce the size of your Groovy code, several `import` statements are automatically included. Notice how the preceding example refers to `@Component`, `@RestController`, and `@RequestMapping` without needing to use fully-qualified names or `import` statements.

|      | Many Spring annotations work without using `import` statements. Try running your application to see what fails before adding imports. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Automatic Main Method

Unlike the equivalent Java application, you do not need to include a `public static void main(String[] args)` method with your `Groovy` scripts. A `SpringApplication` is automatically created, with your compiled code acting as the `source`.

##### Custom Dependency Management

By default, the CLI uses the dependency management declared in `spring-boot-dependencies` when resolving `@Grab` dependencies. Additional dependency management, which overrides the default dependency management, can be configured by using the `@DependencyManagementBom` annotation. The annotation’s value should specify the coordinates (`groupId:artifactId:version`) of one or more Maven BOMs.

For example, consider the following declaration:

```groovy
@DependencyManagementBom("com.example.custom-bom:1.0.0")
```

The preceding declaration picks up `custom-bom-1.0.0.pom` in a Maven repository under `com/example/custom-versions/1.0.0/`.

When you specify multiple BOMs, they are applied in the order in which you declare them, as shown in the following example:

```java
@DependencyManagementBom(["com.example.custom-bom:1.0.0",
        "com.example.another-bom:1.0.0"])
```

The preceding example indicates that the dependency management in `another-bom` overrides the dependency management in `custom-bom`.

You can use `@DependencyManagementBom` anywhere that you can use `@Grab`. However, to ensure consistent ordering of the dependency management, you can use `@DependencyManagementBom` at most once in your application.

#### 7.2.2. Applications with Multiple Source Files

You can use “shell globbing” with all commands that accept file input. Doing so lets you use multiple files from a single directory, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring run *.groovy
```

#### 7.2.3. Packaging Your Application

You can use the `jar` command to package your application into a self-contained executable jar file, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring jar my-app.jar *.groovy
```

The resulting jar contains the classes produced by compiling the application and all of the application’s dependencies so that it can then be run by using `java -jar`. The jar file also contains entries from the application’s classpath. You can add and remove explicit paths to the jar by using `--include` and `--exclude`. Both are comma-separated, and both accept prefixes, in the form of “+” and “-”, to signify that they should be removed from the defaults. The default includes are as follows:

```
public/**, resources/**, static/**, templates/**, META-INF/**, *
```

The default excludes are as follows:

```
.*, repository/**, build/**, target/**, **/*.jar, **/*.groovy
```

Type `spring help jar` on the command line for more information.

#### 7.2.4. Initialize a New Project

The `init` command lets you create a new project by using [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) without leaving the shell, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa my-project
Using service at https://start.spring.io
Project extracted to '/Users/developer/example/my-project'
```

The preceding example creates a `my-project` directory with a Maven-based project that uses `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`. You can list the capabilities of the service by using the `--list` flag, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring init --list

maven-build -  Maven POM [format:build, build:maven]
maven-project -  Maven Project [format:project, build:maven] (default)

...
```

The `init` command supports many options. See the `help` output for more details. For instance, the following command creates a Gradle project that uses Java 8 and `war` packaging:

```
$ spring init --build=gradle --java-version=1.8 --dependencies=websocket --packaging=war sample-app.zip
Using service at https://start.spring.io
Content saved to 'sample-app.zip'
```

#### 7.2.5. Using the Embedded Shell

Spring Boot includes command-line completion scripts for the BASH and zsh shells. If you do not use either of these shells (perhaps you are a Windows user), you can use the `shell` command to launch an integrated shell, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring shell
Spring Boot (v2.2.9.RELEASE)
Hit TAB to complete. Type \'help' and hit RETURN for help, and \'exit' to quit.
```

From inside the embedded shell, you can run other commands directly:

```
$ version
Spring CLI v2.2.9.RELEASE
```

The embedded shell supports ANSI color output as well as `tab` completion. If you need to run a native command, you can use the `!` prefix. To exit the embedded shell, press `ctrl-c`.

#### 7.2.6. Adding Extensions to the CLI

You can add extensions to the CLI by using the `install` command. The command takes one or more sets of artifact coordinates in the format `group:artifact:version`, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring install com.example:spring-boot-cli-extension:1.0.0.RELEASE
```

In addition to installing the artifacts identified by the coordinates you supply, all of the artifacts' dependencies are also installed.

To uninstall a dependency, use the `uninstall` command. As with the `install` command, it takes one or more sets of artifact coordinates in the format of `group:artifact:version`, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring uninstall com.example:spring-boot-cli-extension:1.0.0.RELEASE
```

It uninstalls the artifacts identified by the coordinates you supply and their dependencies.

To uninstall all additional dependencies, you can use the `--all` option, as shown in the following example:

```
$ spring uninstall --all
```

### 7.3. Developing Applications with the Groovy Beans DSL

Spring Framework 4.0 has native support for a `beans{}` “DSL” (borrowed from [Grails](https://grails.org/)), and you can embed bean definitions in your Groovy application scripts by using the same format. This is sometimes a good way to include external features like middleware declarations, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class Application implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    SharedService service

    @Override
    void run(String... args) {
        println service.message
    }

}

import my.company.SharedService

beans {
    service(SharedService) {
        message = "Hello World"
    }
}
```

You can mix class declarations with `beans{}` in the same file as long as they stay at the top level, or, if you prefer, you can put the beans DSL in a separate file.

### 7.4. Configuring the CLI with `settings.xml`

The Spring Boot CLI uses Aether, Maven’s dependency resolution engine, to resolve dependencies. The CLI makes use of the Maven configuration found in `~/.m2/settings.xml` to configure Aether. The following configuration settings are honored by the CLI:

- Offline
- Mirrors
- Servers
- Proxies
- Profiles
  - Activation
  - Repositories
- Active profiles

See [Maven’s settings documentation](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html) for further information.

### 7.5. What to Read Next

There are some [sample groovy scripts](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-cli/samples) available from the GitHub repository that you can use to try out the Spring Boot CLI. There is also extensive Javadoc throughout the [source code](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-cli/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/cli).

If you find that you reach the limit of the CLI tool, you probably want to look at converting your application to a full Gradle or Maven built “Groovy project”. The next section covers Spring Boot’s "[Build tool plugins](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins)", which you can use with Gradle or Maven.

## 8. Build Tool Plugins

Spring Boot provides build tool plugins for Maven and Gradle. The plugins offer a variety of features, including the packaging of executable jars. This section provides more details on both plugins as well as some help should you need to extend an unsupported build system. If you are just getting started, you might want to read “[Build Systems](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-build-systems)” from the “[Using Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot)” section first.

### 8.1. Spring Boot Maven Plugin

The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Maven, letting you package executable jar or war archives and run an application “in-place”. To use it, you must use Maven 3.2 (or later).

|      | See the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin Site](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin/) for complete plugin documentation. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 8.1.1. Including the Plugin

To use the Spring Boot Maven Plugin, include the appropriate XML in the `plugins` section of your `pom.xml`, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <!-- ... -->
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>repackage</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

The preceding configuration repackages a jar or war that is built during the `package` phase of the Maven lifecycle. The following example shows both the repackaged jar as well as the original jar in the `target` directory:

```
$ mvn package
$ ls target/*.jar
target/myproject-1.0.0.jar target/myproject-1.0.0.jar.original
```

If you do not include the `` configuration, as shown in the prior example, you can run the plugin on its own (but only if the package goal is used as well), as shown in the following example:

```
$ mvn package spring-boot:repackage
$ ls target/*.jar
target/myproject-1.0.0.jar target/myproject-1.0.0.jar.original
```

If you use a milestone or snapshot release, you also need to add the appropriate `pluginRepository` elements, as shown in the following listing:

```xml
<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>spring-snapshots</id>
        <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
    </pluginRepository>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>spring-milestones</id>
        <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
    </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
```

#### 8.1.2. Packaging Executable Jar and War Files

Once `spring-boot-maven-plugin` has been included in your `pom.xml`, it automatically tries to rewrite archives to make them executable by using the `spring-boot:repackage` goal. You should configure your project to build a jar or war (as appropriate) by using the usual `packaging` element, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <!-- ... -->
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <!-- ... -->
</project>
```

Your existing archive is enhanced by Spring Boot during the `package` phase. The main class that you want to launch can be specified either by using a configuration option, as shown below, or by adding a `Main-Class` attribute to the manifest. If you do not specify a main class, the plugin searches for a class with a `public static void main(String[] args)` method.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <mainClass>com.example.app.Main</mainClass>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

To build and run a project artifact, you can type the following:

```
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/mymodule-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To build a war file that is both executable and deployable into an external container, you need to mark the embedded container dependencies as “provided”, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <!-- ... -->
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    <!-- ... -->
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- ... -->
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

|      | See the “[Create a Deployable War File](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-create-a-deployable-war-file)” section for more details on how to create a deployable war file. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Advanced configuration options and examples are available in the [plugin info page](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin/).

### 8.2. Spring Boot Gradle Plugin

The Spring Boot Gradle Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Gradle, letting you package executable jar or war archives, run Spring Boot applications, and use the dependency management provided by `spring-boot-dependencies`. It requires Gradle 5.x (4.10 is also supported but this support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release). Please refer to the plugin’s documentation to learn more:

- Reference ([HTML](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html/) and [PDF](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/pdf/spring-boot-gradle-plugin-reference.pdf))
- [API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/api/)

### 8.3. Spring Boot AntLib Module

The Spring Boot AntLib module provides basic Spring Boot support for Apache Ant. You can use the module to create executable jars. To use the module, you need to declare an additional `spring-boot` namespace in your `build.xml`, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<project xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant"
    xmlns:spring-boot="antlib:org.springframework.boot.ant"
    name="myapp" default="build">
    ...
</project>
```

You need to remember to start Ant using the `-lib` option, as shown in the following example:

```
$ ant -lib <folder containing spring-boot-antlib-2.2.9.RELEASE.jar>
```

|      | The “Using Spring Boot” section includes a more complete example of [using Apache Ant with `spring-boot-antlib`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-ant). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 8.3.1. Spring Boot Ant Tasks

Once the `spring-boot-antlib` namespace has been declared, the following additional tasks are available:

- [`spring-boot:exejar`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-boot-ant-exejar)
- [`spring-boot:findmainclass`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-boot-ant-findmainclass)

##### `spring-boot:exejar`

You can use the `exejar` task to create a Spring Boot executable jar. The following attributes are supported by the task:

| Attribute     | Description                            | Required                                                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `destfile`    | The destination jar file to create     | Yes                                                          |
| `classes`     | The root directory of Java class files | Yes                                                          |
| `start-class` | The main application class to run      | No *(the default is the first class found that declares a `main` method)* |

The following nested elements can be used with the task:

| Element     | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resources` | One or more [Resource Collections](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/resources.html#collection) describing a set of [Resources](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/resources.html) that should be added to the content of the created jar file. |
| `lib`       | One or more [Resource Collections](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/resources.html#collection) that should be added to the set of jar libraries that make up the runtime dependency classpath of the application. |

##### Examples

This section shows two examples of Ant tasks.

Specify start-class

```xml
<spring-boot:exejar destfile="target/my-application.jar"
        classes="target/classes" start-class="com.example.MyApplication">
    <resources>
        <fileset dir="src/main/resources" />
    </resources>
    <lib>
        <fileset dir="lib" />
    </lib>
</spring-boot:exejar>
```

Detect start-class

```xml
<exejar destfile="target/my-application.jar" classes="target/classes">
    <lib>
        <fileset dir="lib" />
    </lib>
</exejar>
```

#### 8.3.2. `spring-boot:findmainclass`

The `findmainclass` task is used internally by `exejar` to locate a class declaring a `main`. If necessary, you can also use this task directly in your build. The following attributes are supported:

| Attribute     | Description                                          | Required                                    |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `classesroot` | The root directory of Java class files               | Yes *(unless `mainclass` is specified)*     |
| `mainclass`   | Can be used to short-circuit the `main` class search | No                                          |
| `property`    | The Ant property that should be set with the result  | No *(result will be logged if unspecified)* |

##### Examples

This section contains three examples of using `findmainclass`.

Find and log

```xml
<findmainclass classesroot="target/classes" />
```

Find and set

```xml
<findmainclass classesroot="target/classes" property="main-class" />
```

Override and set

```xml
<findmainclass mainclass="com.example.MainClass" property="main-class" />
```

### 8.4. Supporting Other Build Systems

If you want to use a build tool other than Maven, Gradle, or Ant, you likely need to develop your own plugin. Executable jars need to follow a specific format and certain entries need to be written in an uncompressed form (see the “[executable jar format](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#executable-jar)” section in the appendix for details).

The Spring Boot Maven and Gradle plugins both make use of `spring-boot-loader-tools` to actually generate jars. If you need to, you may use this library directly.

#### 8.4.1. Repackaging Archives

To repackage an existing archive so that it becomes a self-contained executable archive, use `org.springframework.boot.loader.tools.Repackager`. The `Repackager` class takes a single constructor argument that refers to an existing jar or war archive. Use one of the two available `repackage()` methods to either replace the original file or write to a new destination. Various settings can also be configured on the repackager before it is run.

#### 8.4.2. Nested Libraries

When repackaging an archive, you can include references to dependency files by using the `org.springframework.boot.loader.tools.Libraries` interface. We do not provide any concrete implementations of `Libraries` here as they are usually build-system-specific.

If your archive already includes libraries, you can use `Libraries.NONE`.

#### 8.4.3. Finding a Main Class

If you do not use `Repackager.setMainClass()` to specify a main class, the repackager uses [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) to read class files and tries to find a suitable class with a `public static void main(String[] args)` method. An exception is thrown if more than one candidate is found.

#### 8.4.4. Example Repackage Implementation

The following example shows a typical repackage implementation:

```java
Repackager repackager = new Repackager(sourceJarFile);
repackager.setBackupSource(false);
repackager.repackage(new Libraries() {
            @Override
            public void doWithLibraries(LibraryCallback callback) throws IOException {
                // Build system specific implementation, callback for each dependency
                // callback.library(new Library(nestedFile, LibraryScope.COMPILE));
            }
        });
```

### 8.5. What to Read Next

If you are interested in how the build tool plugins work, you can look at the [`spring-boot-tools`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools) module on GitHub. More technical details of the executable jar format are covered in [the appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#executable-jar).

If you have specific build-related questions, you can check out the “[how-to](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto)” guides.

## 9. “How-to” Guides

This section provides answers to some common ‘how do I do that…’ questions that often arise when using Spring Boot. Its coverage is not exhaustive, but it does cover quite a lot.

If you have a specific problem that we do not cover here, you might want to check out [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot) to see if someone has already provided an answer. This is also a great place to ask new questions (please use the `spring-boot` tag).

We are also more than happy to extend this section. If you want to add a ‘how-to’, send us a [pull request](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE).

### 9.1. Spring Boot Application

This section includes topics relating directly to Spring Boot applications.

#### 9.1.1. Create Your Own FailureAnalyzer

[`FailureAnalyzer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/diagnostics/FailureAnalyzer.html) is a great way to intercept an exception on startup and turn it into a human-readable message, wrapped in a [`FailureAnalysis`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/diagnostics/FailureAnalysis.html). Spring Boot provides such an analyzer for application-context-related exceptions, JSR-303 validations, and more. You can also create your own.

`AbstractFailureAnalyzer` is a convenient extension of `FailureAnalyzer` that checks the presence of a specified exception type in the exception to handle. You can extend from that so that your implementation gets a chance to handle the exception only when it is actually present. If, for whatever reason, you cannot handle the exception, return `null` to give another implementation a chance to handle the exception.

`FailureAnalyzer` implementations must be registered in `META-INF/spring.factories`. The following example registers `ProjectConstraintViolationFailureAnalyzer`:

```properties
org.springframework.boot.diagnostics.FailureAnalyzer=\
com.example.ProjectConstraintViolationFailureAnalyzer
```

|      | If you need access to the `BeanFactory` or the `Environment`, your `FailureAnalyzer` can implement `BeanFactoryAware` or `EnvironmentAware` respectively. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.1.2. Troubleshoot Auto-configuration

The Spring Boot auto-configuration tries its best to “do the right thing”, but sometimes things fail, and it can be hard to tell why.

There is a really useful `ConditionEvaluationReport` available in any Spring Boot `ApplicationContext`. You can see it if you enable `DEBUG` logging output. If you use the `spring-boot-actuator` (see [the Actuator chapter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready)), there is also a `conditions` endpoint that renders the report in JSON. Use that endpoint to debug the application and see what features have been added (and which have not been added) by Spring Boot at runtime.

Many more questions can be answered by looking at the source code and the Javadoc. When reading the code, remember the following rules of thumb:

- Look for classes called `*AutoConfiguration` and read their sources. Pay special attention to the `@Conditional*` annotations to find out what features they enable and when. Add `--debug` to the command line or a System property `-Ddebug` to get a log on the console of all the auto-configuration decisions that were made in your app. In a running application with actuator enabled, look at the `conditions` endpoint (`/actuator/conditions` or the JMX equivalent) for the same information.
- Look for classes that are `@ConfigurationProperties` (such as [`ServerProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/ServerProperties.java)) and read from there the available external configuration options. The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation has a `name` attribute that acts as a prefix to external properties. Thus, `ServerProperties` has `prefix="server"` and its configuration properties are `server.port`, `server.address`, and others. In a running application with actuator enabled, look at the `configprops` endpoint.
- Look for uses of the `bind` method on the `Binder` to pull configuration values explicitly out of the `Environment` in a relaxed manner. It is often used with a prefix.
- Look for `@Value` annotations that bind directly to the `Environment`.
- Look for `@ConditionalOnExpression` annotations that switch features on and off in response to SpEL expressions, normally evaluated with placeholders resolved from the `Environment`.

#### 9.1.3. Customize the Environment or ApplicationContext Before It Starts

A `SpringApplication` has `ApplicationListeners` and `ApplicationContextInitializers` that are used to apply customizations to the context or environment. Spring Boot loads a number of such customizations for use internally from `META-INF/spring.factories`. There is more than one way to register additional customizations:

- Programmatically, per application, by calling the `addListeners` and `addInitializers` methods on `SpringApplication` before you run it.
- Declaratively, per application, by setting the `context.initializer.classes` or `context.listener.classes` properties.
- Declaratively, for all applications, by adding a `META-INF/spring.factories` and packaging a jar file that the applications all use as a library.

The `SpringApplication` sends some special `ApplicationEvents` to the listeners (some even before the context is created) and then registers the listeners for events published by the `ApplicationContext` as well. See “[Application Events and Listeners](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-application-events-and-listeners)” in the ‘Spring Boot features’ section for a complete list.

It is also possible to customize the `Environment` before the application context is refreshed by using `EnvironmentPostProcessor`. Each implementation should be registered in `META-INF/spring.factories`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
org.springframework.boot.env.EnvironmentPostProcessor=com.example.YourEnvironmentPostProcessor
```

The implementation can load arbitrary files and add them to the `Environment`. For instance, the following example loads a YAML configuration file from the classpath:

```java
public class EnvironmentPostProcessorExample implements EnvironmentPostProcessor {

    private final YamlPropertySourceLoader loader = new YamlPropertySourceLoader();

    @Override
    public void postProcessEnvironment(ConfigurableEnvironment environment, SpringApplication application) {
        Resource path = new ClassPathResource("com/example/myapp/config.yml");
        PropertySource<?> propertySource = loadYaml(path);
        environment.getPropertySources().addLast(propertySource);
    }

    private PropertySource<?> loadYaml(Resource path) {
        if (!path.exists()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Resource " + path + " does not exist");
        }
        try {
            return this.loader.load("custom-resource", path).get(0);
        }
        catch (IOException ex) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to load yaml configuration from " + path, ex);
        }
    }

}
```

|      | The `Environment` has already been prepared with all the usual property sources that Spring Boot loads by default. It is therefore possible to get the location of the file from the environment. The preceding example adds the `custom-resource` property source at the end of the list so that a key defined in any of the usual other locations takes precedence. A custom implementation may define another order. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | While using `@PropertySource` on your `@SpringBootApplication` may seem to be a convenient way to load a custom resource in the `Environment`, we do not recommend it. Such property sources are not added to the `Environment` until the application context is being refreshed. This is too late to configure certain properties such as `logging.*` and `spring.main.*` which are read before refresh begins. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.1.4. Build an ApplicationContext Hierarchy (Adding a Parent or Root Context)

You can use the `ApplicationBuilder` class to create parent/child `ApplicationContext` hierarchies. See “[Fluent Builder API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-fluent-builder-api)” in the ‘Spring Boot features’ section for more information.

#### 9.1.5. Create a Non-web Application

Not all Spring applications have to be web applications (or web services). If you want to execute some code in a `main` method but also bootstrap a Spring application to set up the infrastructure to use, you can use the `SpringApplication` features of Spring Boot. A `SpringApplication` changes its `ApplicationContext` class, depending on whether it thinks it needs a web application or not. The first thing you can do to help it is to leave server-related dependencies (e.g. servlet API) off the classpath. If you cannot do that (for example, you run two applications from the same code base) then you can explicitly call `setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.NONE)` on your `SpringApplication` instance or set the `applicationContextClass` property (through the Java API or with external properties). Application code that you want to run as your business logic can be implemented as a `CommandLineRunner` and dropped into the context as a `@Bean` definition.

### 9.2. Properties and Configuration

This section includes topics about setting and reading properties and configuration settings and their interaction with Spring Boot applications.

#### 9.2.1. Automatically Expand Properties at Build Time

Rather than hardcoding some properties that are also specified in your project’s build configuration, you can automatically expand them by instead using the existing build configuration. This is possible in both Maven and Gradle.

##### Automatic Property Expansion Using Maven

You can automatically expand properties from the Maven project by using resource filtering. If you use the `spring-boot-starter-parent`, you can then refer to your Maven ‘project properties’ with `@..@` placeholders, as shown in the following example:

```properties
app.encoding=@project.build.sourceEncoding@
app.java.version=@java.version@
```

|      | Only production configuration is filtered that way (in other words, no filtering is applied on `src/test/resources`). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you enable the `addResources` flag, the `spring-boot:run` goal can add `src/main/resources` directly to the classpath (for hot reloading purposes). Doing so circumvents the resource filtering and this feature. Instead, you can use the `exec:java` goal or customize the plugin’s configuration. See the [plugin usage page](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin//usage.html) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If you do not use the starter parent, you need to include the following element inside the `` element of your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <resource>
        <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
        <filtering>true</filtering>
    </resource>
</resources>
```

You also need to include the following element inside ``:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.7</version>
    <configuration>
        <delimiters>
            <delimiter>@</delimiter>
        </delimiters>
        <useDefaultDelimiters>false</useDefaultDelimiters>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

|      | The `useDefaultDelimiters` property is important if you use standard Spring placeholders (such as `${placeholder}`) in your configuration. If that property is not set to `false`, these may be expanded by the build. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Automatic Property Expansion Using Gradle

You can automatically expand properties from the Gradle project by configuring the Java plugin’s `processResources` task to do so, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
processResources {
    expand(project.properties)
}
```

You can then refer to your Gradle project’s properties by using placeholders, as shown in the following example:

```properties
app.name=${name}
app.description=${description}
```

|      | Gradle’s `expand` method uses Groovy’s `SimpleTemplateEngine`, which transforms `${..}` tokens. The `${..}` style conflicts with Spring’s own property placeholder mechanism. To use Spring property placeholders together with automatic expansion, escape the Spring property placeholders as follows: `\${..}`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.2.2. Externalize the Configuration of `SpringApplication`

A `SpringApplication` has bean properties (mainly setters), so you can use its Java API as you create the application to modify its behavior. Alternatively, you can externalize the configuration by setting properties in `spring.main.*`. For example, in `application.properties`, you might have the following settings:

```properties
spring.main.web-application-type=none
spring.main.banner-mode=off
```

Then the Spring Boot banner is not printed on startup, and the application is not starting an embedded web server.

Properties defined in external configuration override the values specified with the Java API, with the notable exception of the sources used to create the `ApplicationContext`. Consider the following application:

```java
new SpringApplicationBuilder()
    .bannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF)
    .sources(demo.MyApp.class)
    .run(args);
```

Now consider the following configuration:

```properties
spring.main.sources=com.acme.Config,com.acme.ExtraConfig
spring.main.banner-mode=console
```

The actual application *now* shows the banner (as overridden by configuration) and uses three sources for the `ApplicationContext` (in the following order): `demo.MyApp`, `com.acme.Config`, and `com.acme.ExtraConfig`.

#### 9.2.3. Change the Location of External Properties of an Application

By default, properties from different sources are added to the Spring `Environment` in a defined order (see “[Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config)” in the ‘Spring Boot features’ section for the exact order).

You can also provide the following System properties (or environment variables) to change the behavior:

- `spring.config.name` (`SPRING_CONFIG_NAME`): Defaults to `application` as the root of the file name.
- `spring.config.location` (`SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION`): The file to load (such as a classpath resource or a URL). A separate `Environment` property source is set up for this document and it can be overridden by system properties, environment variables, or the command line.

No matter what you set in the environment, Spring Boot always loads `application.properties` as described above. By default, if YAML is used, then files with the ‘.yml’ extension are also added to the list.

Spring Boot logs the configuration files that are loaded at the `DEBUG` level and the candidates it has not found at `TRACE` level.

See [`ConfigFileApplicationListener`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/context/config/ConfigFileApplicationListener.java) for more detail.

#### 9.2.4. Use ‘Short’ Command Line Arguments

Some people like to use (for example) `--port=9000` instead of `--server.port=9000` to set configuration properties on the command line. You can enable this behavior by using placeholders in `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
server.port=${port:8080}
```

|      | If you inherit from the `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM, the default filter token of the `maven-resources-plugins` has been changed from `${*}` to `@` (that is, `@maven.token@` instead of `${maven.token}`) to prevent conflicts with Spring-style placeholders. If you have enabled Maven filtering for the `application.properties` directly, you may want to also change the default filter token to use [other delimiters](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/resources-mojo.html#delimiters). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | In this specific case, the port binding works in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Cloud Foundry. In those two platforms, the `PORT` environment variable is set automatically and Spring can bind to capitalized synonyms for `Environment` properties. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.2.5. Use YAML for External Properties

YAML is a superset of JSON and, as such, is a convenient syntax for storing external properties in a hierarchical format, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
spring:
    application:
        name: cruncher
    datasource:
        driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
        url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
server:
    port: 9000
```

Create a file called `application.yml` and put it in the root of your classpath. Then add `snakeyaml` to your dependencies (Maven coordinates `org.yaml:snakeyaml`, already included if you use the `spring-boot-starter`). A YAML file is parsed to a Java `Map` (like a JSON object), and Spring Boot flattens the map so that it is one level deep and has period-separated keys, as many people are used to with `Properties` files in Java.

The preceding example YAML corresponds to the following `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.application.name=cruncher
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
server.port=9000
```

See “[Using YAML Instead of Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-yaml)” in the ‘Spring Boot features’ section for more information about YAML.

#### 9.2.6. Set the Active Spring Profiles

The Spring `Environment` has an API for this, but you would normally set a System property (`spring.profiles.active`) or an OS environment variable (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`). Also, you can launch your application with a `-D` argument (remember to put it before the main class or jar archive), as follows:

```
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=production demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

In Spring Boot, you can also set the active profile in `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=production
```

A value set this way is replaced by the System property or environment variable setting but not by the `SpringApplicationBuilder.profiles()` method. Thus, the latter Java API can be used to augment the profiles without changing the defaults.

See “[Profiles](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-profiles)” in the “Spring Boot features” section for more information.

#### 9.2.7. Change Configuration Depending on the Environment

A YAML file is actually a sequence of documents separated by `---` lines, and each document is parsed separately to a flattened map.

If a YAML document contains a `spring.profiles` key, then the profiles value (a comma-separated list of profiles) is fed into the Spring `Environment.acceptsProfiles()` method. If any of those profiles is active, that document is included in the final merge (otherwise, it is not), as shown in the following example:

```yaml
server:
    port: 9000
---

spring:
    profiles: development
server:
    port: 9001

---

spring:
    profiles: production
server:
    port: 0
```

In the preceding example, the default port is 9000. However, if the Spring profile called ‘development’ is active, then the port is 9001. If ‘production’ is active, then the port is 0.

|      | The YAML documents are merged in the order in which they are encountered. Later values override earlier values. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To do the same thing with properties files, you can use `application-${profile}.properties` to specify profile-specific values.

#### 9.2.8. Discover Built-in Options for External Properties

Spring Boot binds external properties from `application.properties` (or `.yml` files and other places) into an application at runtime. There is not (and technically cannot be) an exhaustive list of all supported properties in a single location, because contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath.

A running application with the Actuator features has a `configprops` endpoint that shows all the bound and bindable properties available through `@ConfigurationProperties`.

The appendix includes an [`application.properties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties) example with a list of the most common properties supported by Spring Boot. The definitive list comes from searching the source code for `@ConfigurationProperties` and `@Value` annotations as well as the occasional use of `Binder`. For more about the exact ordering of loading properties, see "[Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config)".

### 9.3. Embedded Web Servers

Each Spring Boot web application includes an embedded web server. This feature leads to a number of how-to questions, including how to change the embedded server and how to configure the embedded server. This section answers those questions.

#### 9.3.1. Use Another Web Server

Many Spring Boot starters include default embedded containers.

- For servlet stack applications, the `spring-boot-starter-web` includes Tomcat by including `spring-boot-starter-tomcat`, but you can use `spring-boot-starter-jetty` or `spring-boot-starter-undertow` instead.
- For reactive stack applications, the `spring-boot-starter-webflux` includes Reactor Netty by including `spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty`, but you can use `spring-boot-starter-tomcat`, `spring-boot-starter-jetty`, or `spring-boot-starter-undertow` instead.

When switching to a different HTTP server, you need to exclude the default dependencies in addition to including the one you need. To help with this process, Spring Boot provides a separate starter for each of the supported HTTP servers.

The following Maven example shows how to exclude Tomcat and include Jetty for Spring MVC:

```xml
<properties>
    <servlet-api.version>3.1.0</servlet-api.version>
</properties>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency -->
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<!-- Use Jetty instead -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

|      | The version of the Servlet API has been overridden as, unlike Tomcat 9 and Undertow 2.0, Jetty 9.4 does not support Servlet 4.0. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following Gradle example shows how to exclude Netty and include Undertow for Spring WebFlux:

```groovy
configurations {
    // exclude Reactor Netty
    compile.exclude module: 'spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty'
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux'
    // Use Undertow instead
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-undertow'
    // ...
}
```

|      | `spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty` is required to use the `WebClient` class, so you may need to keep a dependency on Netty even when you need to include a different HTTP server. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.3.2. Disabling the Web Server

If your classpath contains the necessary bits to start a web server, Spring Boot will automatically start it. To disable this behavior configure the `WebApplicationType` in your `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.main.web-application-type=none
```

#### 9.3.3. Change the HTTP Port

In a standalone application, the main HTTP port defaults to `8080` but can be set with `server.port` (for example, in `application.properties` or as a System property). Thanks to relaxed binding of `Environment` values, you can also use `SERVER_PORT` (for example, as an OS environment variable).

To switch off the HTTP endpoints completely but still create a `WebApplicationContext`, use `server.port=-1` (doing so is sometimes useful for testing).

For more details, see “[Customizing Embedded Servlet Containers](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-customizing-embedded-containers)” in the ‘Spring Boot Features’ section, or the [`ServerProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/ServerProperties.java) source code.

#### 9.3.4. Use a Random Unassigned HTTP Port

To scan for a free port (using OS natives to prevent clashes) use `server.port=0`.

#### 9.3.5. Discover the HTTP Port at Runtime

You can access the port the server is running on from log output or from the `ServletWebServerApplicationContext` through its `WebServer`. The best way to get that and be sure that it has been initialized is to add a `@Bean` of type `ApplicationListener` and pull the container out of the event when it is published.

Tests that use `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)` can also inject the actual port into a field by using the `@LocalServerPort` annotation, as shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class MyWebIntegrationTests {

    @Autowired
    ServletWebServerApplicationContext server;

    @LocalServerPort
    int port;

    // ...

}
```

|      | `@LocalServerPort` is a meta-annotation for `@Value("${local.server.port}")`. Do not try to inject the port in a regular application. As we just saw, the value is set only after the container has been initialized. Contrary to a test, application code callbacks are processed early (before the value is actually available). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.3.6. Enable HTTP Response Compression

HTTP response compression is supported by Jetty, Tomcat, and Undertow. It can be enabled in `application.properties`, as follows:

```properties
server.compression.enabled=true
```

By default, responses must be at least 2048 bytes in length for compression to be performed. You can configure this behavior by setting the `server.compression.min-response-size` property.

By default, responses are compressed only if their content type is one of the following:

- `text/html`
- `text/xml`
- `text/plain`
- `text/css`
- `text/javascript`
- `application/javascript`
- `application/json`
- `application/xml`

You can configure this behavior by setting the `server.compression.mime-types` property.

#### 9.3.7. Configure SSL

SSL can be configured declaratively by setting the various `server.ssl.*` properties, typically in `application.properties` or `application.yml`. The following example shows setting SSL properties in `application.properties`:

```properties
server.port=8443
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.jks
server.ssl.key-store-password=secret
server.ssl.key-password=another-secret
```

See [`Ssl`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/web/server/Ssl.java) for details of all of the supported properties.

Using configuration such as the preceding example means the application no longer supports a plain HTTP connector at port 8080. Spring Boot does not support the configuration of both an HTTP connector and an HTTPS connector through `application.properties`. If you want to have both, you need to configure one of them programmatically. We recommend using `application.properties` to configure HTTPS, as the HTTP connector is the easier of the two to configure programmatically.

#### 9.3.8. Configure HTTP/2

You can enable HTTP/2 support in your Spring Boot application with the `server.http2.enabled` configuration property. This support depends on the chosen web server and the application environment, since that protocol is not supported out-of-the-box by JDK8.

|      | Spring Boot does not support `h2c`, the cleartext version of the HTTP/2 protocol. So you must [configure SSL first](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-ssl). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### HTTP/2 with Undertow

As of Undertow 1.4.0+, HTTP/2 is supported without any additional requirement on JDK8.

##### HTTP/2 with Jetty

As of Jetty 9.4.8, HTTP/2 is also supported with the [Conscrypt library](https://www.conscrypt.org/). To enable that support, your application needs to have two additional dependencies: `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-alpn-conscrypt-server` and `org.eclipse.jetty.http2:http2-server`.

##### HTTP/2 with Tomcat

Spring Boot ships by default with Tomcat 9.0.x which supports HTTP/2 out of the box when using JDK 9 or later. Alternatively, HTTP/2 can be used on JDK 8 if the `libtcnative` library and its dependencies are installed on the host operating system.

The library folder must be made available, if not already, to the JVM library path. You can do so with a JVM argument such as `-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/opt/tomcat-native/lib`. More on this in the [official Tomcat documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/apr.html).

Starting Tomcat 9.0.x on JDK 8 without that native support logs the following error:

```
ERROR 8787 --- [           main] o.a.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol      : The upgrade handler [org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol] for [h2] only supports upgrade via ALPN but has been configured for the ["https-jsse-nio-8443"] connector that does not support ALPN.
```

This error is not fatal, and the application still starts with HTTP/1.1 SSL support.

##### HTTP/2 with Reactor Netty

The `spring-boot-webflux-starter` is using by default Reactor Netty as a server. Reactor Netty can be configured for HTTP/2 using the JDK support with JDK 9 or later. For JDK 8 environments, or for optimal runtime performance, this server also supports HTTP/2 with native libraries. To enable that, your application needs to have an additional dependency.

Spring Boot manages the version for the `io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` "uber jar", containing native libraries for all platforms. Developers can choose to import only the required dependencies using a classifier (see [the Netty official documentation](https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html)).

#### 9.3.9. Configure the Web Server

Generally, you should first consider using one of the many available configuration keys and customize your web server by adding new entries in your `application.properties` (or `application.yml`, or environment, etc. see “[Discover Built-in Options for External Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-discover-build-in-options-for-external-properties)”). The `server.*` namespace is quite useful here, and it includes namespaces like `server.tomcat.*`, `server.jetty.*` and others, for server-specific features. See the list of [Common Application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties).

The previous sections covered already many common use cases, such as compression, SSL or HTTP/2. However, if a configuration key doesn’t exist for your use case, you should then look at [`WebServerFactoryCustomizer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/api//org/springframework/boot/web/server/WebServerFactoryCustomizer.html). You can declare such a component and get access to the server factory relevant to your choice: you should select the variant for the chosen Server (Tomcat, Jetty, Reactor Netty, Undertow) and the chosen web stack (Servlet or Reactive).

The example below is for Tomcat with the `spring-boot-starter-web` (Servlet stack):

```java
@Component
public class MyTomcatWebServerCustomizer
        implements WebServerFactoryCustomizer<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> {

    @Override
    public void customize(TomcatServletWebServerFactory factory) {
        // customize the factory here
    }
}
```

In addition Spring Boot provides:

| Server   | Servlet stack                     | Reactive stack                     |
| :------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Tomcat   | `TomcatServletWebServerFactory`   | `TomcatReactiveWebServerFactory`   |
| Jetty    | `JettyServletWebServerFactory`    | `JettyReactiveWebServerFactory`    |
| Undertow | `UndertowServletWebServerFactory` | `UndertowReactiveWebServerFactory` |
| Reactor  | N/A                               | `NettyReactiveWebServerFactory`    |

Once you’ve got access to a `WebServerFactory`, you can often add customizers to it to configure specific parts, like connectors, server resources, or the server itself - all using server-specific APIs.

As a last resort, you can also declare your own `WebServerFactory` component, which will override the one provided by Spring Boot. In this case, you can’t rely on configuration properties in the `server` namespace anymore.

#### 9.3.10. Add a Servlet, Filter, or Listener to an Application

In a servlet stack application, i.e. with the `spring-boot-starter-web`, there are two ways to add `Servlet`, `Filter`, `ServletContextListener`, and the other listeners supported by the Servlet API to your application:

- [Add a Servlet, Filter, or Listener by Using a Spring Bean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-add-a-servlet-filter-or-listener-as-spring-bean)
- [Add Servlets, Filters, and Listeners by Using Classpath Scanning](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-add-a-servlet-filter-or-listener-using-scanning)

##### Add a Servlet, Filter, or Listener by Using a Spring Bean

To add a `Servlet`, `Filter`, or Servlet `*Listener` by using a Spring bean, you must provide a `@Bean` definition for it. Doing so can be very useful when you want to inject configuration or dependencies. However, you must be very careful that they do not cause eager initialization of too many other beans, because they have to be installed in the container very early in the application lifecycle. (For example, it is not a good idea to have them depend on your `DataSource` or JPA configuration.) You can work around such restrictions by initializing the beans lazily when first used instead of on initialization.

In the case of `Filters` and `Servlets`, you can also add mappings and init parameters by adding a `FilterRegistrationBean` or a `ServletRegistrationBean` instead of or in addition to the underlying component.

|      | If no `dispatcherType` is specified on a filter registration, `REQUEST` is used. This aligns with the Servlet Specification’s default dispatcher type. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Like any other Spring bean, you can define the order of Servlet filter beans; please make sure to check the “[Registering Servlets, Filters, and Listeners as Spring Beans](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-embedded-container-servlets-filters-listeners-beans)” section.

###### Disable Registration of a Servlet or Filter

As [described earlier](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-add-a-servlet-filter-or-listener-as-spring-bean), any `Servlet` or `Filter` beans are registered with the servlet container automatically. To disable registration of a particular `Filter` or `Servlet` bean, create a registration bean for it and mark it as disabled, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
public FilterRegistrationBean registration(MyFilter filter) {
    FilterRegistrationBean registration = new FilterRegistrationBean(filter);
    registration.setEnabled(false);
    return registration;
}
```

##### Add Servlets, Filters, and Listeners by Using Classpath Scanning

`@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter`, and `@WebListener` annotated classes can be automatically registered with an embedded servlet container by annotating a `@Configuration` class with `@ServletComponentScan` and specifying the package(s) containing the components that you want to register. By default, `@ServletComponentScan` scans from the package of the annotated class.

#### 9.3.11. Configure Access Logging

Access logs can be configured for Tomcat, Undertow, and Jetty through their respective namespaces.

For instance, the following settings log access on Tomcat with a [custom pattern](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/valve.html#Access_Logging).

```properties
server.tomcat.basedir=my-tomcat
server.tomcat.accesslog.enabled=true
server.tomcat.accesslog.pattern=%t %a "%r" %s (%D ms)
```

|      | The default location for logs is a `logs` directory relative to the Tomcat base directory. By default, the `logs` directory is a temporary directory, so you may want to fix Tomcat’s base directory or use an absolute path for the logs. In the preceding example, the logs are available in `my-tomcat/logs` relative to the working directory of the application. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Access logging for Undertow can be configured in a similar fashion, as shown in the following example:

```properties
server.undertow.accesslog.enabled=true
server.undertow.accesslog.pattern=%t %a "%r" %s (%D ms)
```

Logs are stored in a `logs` directory relative to the working directory of the application. You can customize this location by setting the `server.undertow.accesslog.dir` property.

Finally, access logging for Jetty can also be configured as follows:

```properties
server.jetty.accesslog.enabled=true
server.jetty.accesslog.filename=/var/log/jetty-access.log
```

By default, logs are redirected to `System.err`. For more details, see [the Jetty documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.30.v20200611/configuring-jetty-request-logs.html).

#### 9.3.12. Running Behind a Front-end Proxy Server

If your application is running behind a proxy, a load-balancer or in the cloud, the request information (like the host, port, scheme…) might change along the way. Your application may be running on `10.10.10.10:8080`, but HTTP clients should only see `example.org`.

[RFC7239 "Forwarded Headers"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239) defines the `Forwarded` HTTP header; proxies can use this header to provide information about the original request. You can configure your application to read those headers and automatically use that information when creating links and sending them to clients in HTTP 302 responses, JSON documents or HTML pages. There are also non-standard headers, like `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Ssl`, and `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.

If the proxy adds the commonly used `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers, setting `server.forward-headers-strategy` to `NATIVE` is enough to support those. With this option, the Web servers themselves natively support this feature; you can check their specific documentation to learn about specific behavior.

If this is not enough, Spring Framework provides a [ForwardedHeaderFilter](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#filters-forwarded-headers). You can register it as a Servlet Filter in your application by setting `server.forward-headers-strategy` is set to `FRAMEWORK`.

|      | If your application runs in Cloud Foundry or Heroku, the `server.forward-headers-strategy` property defaults to `NATIVE`. In all other instances, it defaults to `NONE`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Customize Tomcat’s Proxy Configuration

If you use Tomcat, you can additionally configure the names of the headers used to carry “forwarded” information, as shown in the following example:

```
server.tomcat.remote-ip-header=x-your-remote-ip-header
server.tomcat.protocol-header=x-your-protocol-header
```

Tomcat is also configured with a default regular expression that matches internal proxies that are to be trusted. By default, IP addresses in `10/8`, `192.168/16`, `169.254/16` and `127/8` are trusted. You can customize the valve’s configuration by adding an entry to `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```
server.tomcat.internal-proxies=192\\.168\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}
```

|      | The double backslashes are required only when you use a properties file for configuration. If you use YAML, single backslashes are sufficient, and a value equivalent to that shown in the preceding example would be `192\.168\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | You can trust all proxies by setting the `internal-proxies` to empty (but do not do so in production). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

You can take complete control of the configuration of Tomcat’s `RemoteIpValve` by switching the automatic one off (to do so, set `server.forward-headers-strategy=NONE`) and adding a new valve instance in a `TomcatServletWebServerFactory` bean.

#### 9.3.13. Enable Multiple Connectors with Tomcat

You can add an `org.apache.catalina.connector.Connector` to the `TomcatServletWebServerFactory`, which can allow multiple connectors, including HTTP and HTTPS connectors, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
public ServletWebServerFactory servletContainer() {
    TomcatServletWebServerFactory tomcat = new TomcatServletWebServerFactory();
    tomcat.addAdditionalTomcatConnectors(createSslConnector());
    return tomcat;
}

private Connector createSslConnector() {
    Connector connector = new Connector("org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol");
    Http11NioProtocol protocol = (Http11NioProtocol) connector.getProtocolHandler();
    try {
        File keystore = new ClassPathResource("keystore").getFile();
        File truststore = new ClassPathResource("keystore").getFile();
        connector.setScheme("https");
        connector.setSecure(true);
        connector.setPort(8443);
        protocol.setSSLEnabled(true);
        protocol.setKeystoreFile(keystore.getAbsolutePath());
        protocol.setKeystorePass("changeit");
        protocol.setTruststoreFile(truststore.getAbsolutePath());
        protocol.setTruststorePass("changeit");
        protocol.setKeyAlias("apitester");
        return connector;
    }
    catch (IOException ex) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("can't access keystore: [" + keystore
                + "] or truststore: [" + truststore + "]", ex);
    }
}
```

#### 9.3.14. Use Tomcat’s LegacyCookieProcessor

By default, the embedded Tomcat used by Spring Boot does not support "Version 0" of the Cookie format, so you may see the following error:

```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: An invalid character [32] was present in the Cookie value
```

If at all possible, you should consider updating your code to only store values compliant with later Cookie specifications. If, however, you cannot change the way that cookies are written, you can instead configure Tomcat to use a `LegacyCookieProcessor`. To switch to the `LegacyCookieProcessor`, use an `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` bean that adds a `TomcatContextCustomizer`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
public WebServerFactoryCustomizer<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> cookieProcessorCustomizer() {
    return (factory) -> factory
            .addContextCustomizers((context) -> context.setCookieProcessor(new LegacyCookieProcessor()));
}
```

#### 9.3.15. Enable Tomcat’s MBean Registry

Embedded Tomcat’s MBean registry is disabled by default. This minimizes Tomcat’s memory footprint. If you want to use Tomcat’s MBeans, for example so that they can be used to expose metrics via Micrometer, you must use the `server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled` property to do so, as shown in the following example:

```properties
server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled=true
```

#### 9.3.16. Enable Multiple Listeners with Undertow

Add an `UndertowBuilderCustomizer` to the `UndertowServletWebServerFactory` and add a listener to the `Builder`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
public UndertowServletWebServerFactory servletWebServerFactory() {
    UndertowServletWebServerFactory factory = new UndertowServletWebServerFactory();
    factory.addBuilderCustomizers(new UndertowBuilderCustomizer() {

        @Override
        public void customize(Builder builder) {
            builder.addHttpListener(8080, "0.0.0.0");
        }

    });
    return factory;
}
```

#### 9.3.17. Create WebSocket Endpoints Using @ServerEndpoint

If you want to use `@ServerEndpoint` in a Spring Boot application that used an embedded container, you must declare a single `ServerEndpointExporter` `@Bean`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
public ServerEndpointExporter serverEndpointExporter() {
    return new ServerEndpointExporter();
}
```

The bean shown in the preceding example registers any `@ServerEndpoint` annotated beans with the underlying WebSocket container. When deployed to a standalone servlet container, this role is performed by a servlet container initializer, and the `ServerEndpointExporter` bean is not required.

### 9.4. Spring MVC

Spring Boot has a number of starters that include Spring MVC. Note that some starters include a dependency on Spring MVC rather than include it directly. This section answers common questions about Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

#### 9.4.1. Write a JSON REST Service

Any Spring `@RestController` in a Spring Boot application should render JSON response by default as long as Jackson2 is on the classpath, as shown in the following example:

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @RequestMapping("/thing")
    public MyThing thing() {
            return new MyThing();
    }

}
```

As long as `MyThing` can be serialized by Jackson2 (true for a normal POJO or Groovy object), then `localhost:8080/thing` serves a JSON representation of it by default. Note that, in a browser, you might sometimes see XML responses, because browsers tend to send accept headers that prefer XML.

#### 9.4.2. Write an XML REST Service

If you have the Jackson XML extension (`jackson-dataformat-xml`) on the classpath, you can use it to render XML responses. The previous example that we used for JSON would work. To use the Jackson XML renderer, add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If Jackson’s XML extension is not available and JAXB is available, XML can be rendered with the additional requirement of having `MyThing` annotated as `@XmlRootElement`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@XmlRootElement
public class MyThing {
    private String name;
    // .. getters and setters
}
```

JAXB is only available out of the box with Java 8. If you’re using a more recent Java generation, add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

|      | To get the server to render XML instead of JSON, you might have to send an `Accept: text/xml` header (or use a browser). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.4.3. Customize the Jackson ObjectMapper

Spring MVC (client and server side) uses `HttpMessageConverters` to negotiate content conversion in an HTTP exchange. If Jackson is on the classpath, you already get the default converter(s) provided by `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder`, an instance of which is auto-configured for you.

The `ObjectMapper` (or `XmlMapper` for Jackson XML converter) instance (created by default) has the following customized properties:

- `MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION` is disabled
- `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` is disabled
- `SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS` is disabled

Spring Boot also has some features to make it easier to customize this behavior.

You can configure the `ObjectMapper` and `XmlMapper` instances by using the environment. Jackson provides an extensive suite of on/off features that can be used to configure various aspects of its processing. These features are described in six enums (in Jackson) that map onto properties in the environment:

| Enum                                                    | Property                                    | Values                                                       |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature` | `spring.jackson.deserialization.`           | `true`, `false`                                              |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator.Feature`      | `spring.jackson.generator.`                 | `true`, `false`                                              |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.MapperFeature`          | `spring.jackson.mapper.`                    | `true`, `false`                                              |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser.Feature`         | `spring.jackson.parser.`                    | `true`, `false`                                              |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializationFeature`   | `spring.jackson.serialization.`             | `true`, `false`                                              |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude.Include`  | `spring.jackson.default-property-inclusion` | `always`, `non_null`, `non_absent`, `non_default`, `non_empty` |

For example, to enable pretty print, set `spring.jackson.serialization.indent_output=true`. Note that, thanks to the use of [relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding), the case of `indent_output` does not have to match the case of the corresponding enum constant, which is `INDENT_OUTPUT`.

This environment-based configuration is applied to the auto-configured `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` bean and applies to any mappers created by using the builder, including the auto-configured `ObjectMapper` bean.

The context’s `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` can be customized by one or more `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer` beans. Such customizer beans can be ordered (Boot’s own customizer has an order of 0), letting additional customization be applied both before and after Boot’s customization.

Any beans of type `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module` are automatically registered with the auto-configured `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` and are applied to any `ObjectMapper` instances that it creates. This provides a global mechanism for contributing custom modules when you add new features to your application.

If you want to replace the default `ObjectMapper` completely, either define a `@Bean` of that type and mark it as `@Primary` or, if you prefer the builder-based approach, define a `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` `@Bean`. Note that, in either case, doing so disables all auto-configuration of the `ObjectMapper`.

If you provide any `@Beans` of type `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`, they replace the default value in the MVC configuration. Also, a convenience bean of type `HttpMessageConverters` is provided (and is always available if you use the default MVC configuration). It has some useful methods to access the default and user-enhanced message converters.

See the “[Customize the @ResponseBody Rendering](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-customize-the-responsebody-rendering)” section and the [`WebMvcAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/servlet/WebMvcAutoConfiguration.java) source code for more details.

#### 9.4.4. Customize the @ResponseBody Rendering

Spring uses `HttpMessageConverters` to render `@ResponseBody` (or responses from `@RestController`). You can contribute additional converters by adding beans of the appropriate type in a Spring Boot context. If a bean you add is of a type that would have been included by default anyway (such as `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` for JSON conversions), it replaces the default value. A convenience bean of type `HttpMessageConverters` is provided and is always available if you use the default MVC configuration. It has some useful methods to access the default and user-enhanced message converters (For example, it can be useful if you want to manually inject them into a custom `RestTemplate`).

As in normal MVC usage, any `WebMvcConfigurer` beans that you provide can also contribute converters by overriding the `configureMessageConverters` method. However, unlike with normal MVC, you can supply only additional converters that you need (because Spring Boot uses the same mechanism to contribute its defaults). Finally, if you opt out of the Spring Boot default MVC configuration by providing your own `@EnableWebMvc` configuration, you can take control completely and do everything manually by using `getMessageConverters` from `WebMvcConfigurationSupport`.

See the [`WebMvcAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/servlet/WebMvcAutoConfiguration.java) source code for more details.

#### 9.4.5. Handling Multipart File Uploads

Spring Boot embraces the Servlet 3 `javax.servlet.http.Part` API to support uploading files. By default, Spring Boot configures Spring MVC with a maximum size of 1MB per file and a maximum of 10MB of file data in a single request. You may override these values, the location to which intermediate data is stored (for example, to the `/tmp` directory), and the threshold past which data is flushed to disk by using the properties exposed in the `MultipartProperties` class. For example, if you want to specify that files be unlimited, set the `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size` property to `-1`.

The multipart support is helpful when you want to receive multipart encoded file data as a `@RequestParam`-annotated parameter of type `MultipartFile` in a Spring MVC controller handler method.

See the [`MultipartAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/servlet/MultipartAutoConfiguration.java) source for more details.

|      | It is recommended to use the container’s built-in support for multipart uploads rather than introducing an additional dependency such as Apache Commons File Upload. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.4.6. Switch Off the Spring MVC DispatcherServlet

By default, all content is served from the root of your application (`/`). If you would rather map to a different path, you can configure one as follows:

```properties
spring.mvc.servlet.path=/acme
```

If you have additional servlets you can declare a `@Bean` of type `Servlet` or `ServletRegistrationBean` for each and Spring Boot will register them transparently to the container. Because servlets are registered that way, they can be mapped to a sub-context of the `DispatcherServlet` without invoking it.

Configuring the `DispatcherServlet` yourself is unusual but if you really need to do it, a `@Bean` of type `DispatcherServletPath` must be provided as well to provide the path of your custom `DispatcherServlet`.

#### 9.4.7. Switch off the Default MVC Configuration

The easiest way to take complete control over MVC configuration is to provide your own `@Configuration` with the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation. Doing so leaves all MVC configuration in your hands.

#### 9.4.8. Customize ViewResolvers

A `ViewResolver` is a core component of Spring MVC, translating view names in `@Controller` to actual `View` implementations. Note that `ViewResolvers` are mainly used in UI applications, rather than REST-style services (a `View` is not used to render a `@ResponseBody`). There are many implementations of `ViewResolver` to choose from, and Spring on its own is not opinionated about which ones you should use. Spring Boot, on the other hand, installs one or two for you, depending on what it finds on the classpath and in the application context. The `DispatcherServlet` uses all the resolvers it finds in the application context, trying each one in turn until it gets a result. If you add your own, you have to be aware of the order and in which position your resolver is added.

`WebMvcAutoConfiguration` adds the following `ViewResolvers` to your context:

- An `InternalResourceViewResolver` named ‘defaultViewResolver’. This one locates physical resources that can be rendered by using the `DefaultServlet` (including static resources and JSP pages, if you use those). It applies a prefix and a suffix to the view name and then looks for a physical resource with that path in the servlet context (the defaults are both empty but are accessible for external configuration through `spring.mvc.view.prefix` and `spring.mvc.view.suffix`). You can override it by providing a bean of the same type.
- A `BeanNameViewResolver` named ‘beanNameViewResolver’. This is a useful member of the view resolver chain and picks up any beans with the same name as the `View` being resolved. It should not be necessary to override or replace it.
- A `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver` named ‘viewResolver’ is added only if there **are** actually beans of type `View` present. This is a ‘master’ resolver, delegating to all the others and attempting to find a match to the ‘Accept’ HTTP header sent by the client. There is a useful [blog about `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver`](https://spring.io/blog/2013/06/03/content-negotiation-using-views) that you might like to study to learn more, and you might also look at the source code for detail. You can switch off the auto-configured `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver` by defining a bean named ‘viewResolver’.
- If you use Thymeleaf, you also have a `ThymeleafViewResolver` named ‘thymeleafViewResolver’. It looks for resources by surrounding the view name with a prefix and suffix. The prefix is `spring.thymeleaf.prefix`, and the suffix is `spring.thymeleaf.suffix`. The values of the prefix and suffix default to ‘classpath:/templates/’ and ‘.html’, respectively. You can override `ThymeleafViewResolver` by providing a bean of the same name.
- If you use FreeMarker, you also have a `FreeMarkerViewResolver` named ‘freeMarkerViewResolver’. It looks for resources in a loader path (which is externalized to `spring.freemarker.templateLoaderPath` and has a default value of ‘classpath:/templates/’) by surrounding the view name with a prefix and a suffix. The prefix is externalized to `spring.freemarker.prefix`, and the suffix is externalized to `spring.freemarker.suffix`. The default values of the prefix and suffix are empty and ‘.ftlh’, respectively. You can override `FreeMarkerViewResolver` by providing a bean of the same name.
- If you use Groovy templates (actually, if `groovy-templates` is on your classpath), you also have a `GroovyMarkupViewResolver` named ‘groovyMarkupViewResolver’. It looks for resources in a loader path by surrounding the view name with a prefix and suffix (externalized to `spring.groovy.template.prefix` and `spring.groovy.template.suffix`). The prefix and suffix have default values of ‘classpath:/templates/’ and ‘.tpl’, respectively. You can override `GroovyMarkupViewResolver` by providing a bean of the same name.
- If you use Mustache, you also have a `MustacheViewResolver` named ‘mustacheViewResolver’. It looks for resources by surrounding the view name with a prefix and suffix. The prefix is `spring.mustache.prefix`, and the suffix is `spring.mustache.suffix`. The values of the prefix and suffix default to ‘classpath:/templates/’ and ‘.mustache’, respectively. You can override `MustacheViewResolver` by providing a bean of the same name.

### 9.5. Testing With Spring Security

Spring Security provides support for running tests as a specific user. For example, the test in the snippet below will run with an authenticated user that has the `ADMIN` role.

```java
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
    mvc
        .perform(get("/"))
        ...
}
```

Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with Spring MVC Test and this can also be used when testing controllers using the `@WebMvcTest` slice and `MockMvc`.

For additional details on Spring Security’s testing support, refer to Spring Security’s [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#test)).

### 9.6. Jersey

#### 9.6.1. Secure Jersey endpoints with Spring Security

Spring Security can be used to secure a Jersey-based web application in much the same way as it can be used to secure a Spring MVC-based web application. However, if you want to use Spring Security’s method-level security with Jersey, you must configure Jersey to use `setStatus(int)` rather `sendError(int)`. This prevents Jersey from committing the response before Spring Security has had an opportunity to report an authentication or authorization failure to the client.

The `jersey.config.server.response.setStatusOverSendError` property must be set to `true` on the application’s `ResourceConfig` bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class JerseyConfig extends ResourceConfig {

    public JerseyConfig() {
        register(Endpoint.class);
        setProperties(Collections.singletonMap("jersey.config.server.response.setStatusOverSendError", true));
    }

}
```

#### 9.6.2. Use Jersey Alongside Another Web Framework

To use Jersey alongside another web framework, such as Spring MVC, it should be configured so that it will allow the other framework to handle requests that it cannot handle. First, configure Jersey to use a Filter rather than a Servlet by configuring the `spring.jersey.type` application property with a value of `filter`. Second, configure your `ResourceConfig` to forward requests that would have resulted in a 404, as shown in the following example.

```java
@Component
public class JerseyConfig extends ResourceConfig {

    public JerseyConfig() {
        register(Endpoint.class);
        property(ServletProperties.FILTER_FORWARD_ON_404, true);
    }

}
```

### 9.7. HTTP Clients

Spring Boot offers a number of starters that work with HTTP clients. This section answers questions related to using them.

#### 9.7.1. Configure RestTemplate to Use a Proxy

As described in [RestTemplate Customization](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-resttemplate-customization), you can use a `RestTemplateCustomizer` with `RestTemplateBuilder` to build a customized `RestTemplate`. This is the recommended approach for creating a `RestTemplate` configured to use a proxy.

The exact details of the proxy configuration depend on the underlying client request factory that is being used. The following example configures `HttpComponentsClientRequestFactory` with an `HttpClient` that uses a proxy for all hosts except `192.168.0.5`:

```java
static class ProxyCustomizer implements RestTemplateCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
        HttpHost proxy = new HttpHost("proxy.example.com");
        HttpClient httpClient = HttpClientBuilder.create().setRoutePlanner(new DefaultProxyRoutePlanner(proxy) {

            @Override
            public HttpHost determineProxy(HttpHost target, HttpRequest request, HttpContext context)
                    throws HttpException {
                if (target.getHostName().equals("192.168.0.5")) {
                    return null;
                }
                return super.determineProxy(target, request, context);
            }

        }).build();
        restTemplate.setRequestFactory(new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory(httpClient));
    }

}
```

#### 9.7.2. Configure the TcpClient used by a Reactor Netty-based WebClient

When Reactor Netty is on the classpath a Reactor Netty-based `WebClient` is auto-configured. To customize the client’s handling of network connections, provide a `ClientHttpConnector` bean. The following example configures a 60 second connect timeout and adds a `ReadTimeoutHandler`:

```java
@Bean
ClientHttpConnector clientHttpConnector(ReactorResourceFactory resourceFactory) {
    TcpClient tcpClient = TcpClient.create(resourceFactory.getConnectionProvider())
            .runOn(resourceFactory.getLoopResources()).option(ChannelOption.CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, 60000)
            .doOnConnected((connection) -> connection.addHandlerLast(new ReadTimeoutHandler(60)));
    return new ReactorClientHttpConnector(HttpClient.from(tcpClient));
}
```

|      | Note the use of `ReactorResourceFactory` for the connection provider and event loop resources. This ensures efficient sharing of resources for the server receiving requests and the client making requests. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 9.8. Logging

Spring Boot has no mandatory logging dependency, except for the Commons Logging API, which is typically provided by Spring Framework’s `spring-jcl` module. To use [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/), you need to include it and `spring-jcl` on the classpath. The recommended way to do that is through the starters, which all depend on `spring-boot-starter-logging`. For a web application, you need only `spring-boot-starter-web`, since it depends transitively on the logging starter. If you use Maven, the following dependency adds logging for you:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Spring Boot has a `LoggingSystem` abstraction that attempts to configure logging based on the content of the classpath. If Logback is available, it is the first choice.

If the only change you need to make to logging is to set the levels of various loggers, you can do so in `application.properties` by using the "logging.level" prefix, as shown in the following example:

```properties
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```

You can also set the location of a file to which to write the log (in addition to the console) by using "logging.file.name".

To configure the more fine-grained settings of a logging system, you need to use the native configuration format supported by the `LoggingSystem` in question. By default, Spring Boot picks up the native configuration from its default location for the system (such as `classpath:logback.xml` for Logback), but you can set the location of the config file by using the `logging.config` property.

#### 9.8.1. Configure Logback for Logging

If you need to apply customizations to logback beyond those that can be achieved with `application.properties`, you’ll need to add a standard logback configuration file. You can add a `logback.xml` file to the root of your classpath for logback to find. You can also use `logback-spring.xml` if you want to use the [Spring Boot Logback extensions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-logback-extensions).

|      | The Logback documentation has a [dedicated section that covers configuration](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) in some detail. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Spring Boot provides a number of logback configurations that be `included` from your own configuration. These includes are designed to allow certain common Spring Boot conventions to be re-applied.

The following files are provided under `org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/`:

- `defaults.xml` - Provides conversion rules, pattern properties and common logger configurations.
- `console-appender.xml` - Adds a `ConsoleAppender` using the `CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN`.
- `file-appender.xml` - Adds a `RollingFileAppender` using the `FILE_LOG_PATTERN` and `ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN` with appropriate settings.

In addition, a legacy `base.xml` file is provided for compatibility with earlier versions of Spring Boot.

A typical custom `logback.xml` file would look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml"/>
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/console-appender.xml" />
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
    </root>
    <logger name="org.springframework.web" level="DEBUG"/>
</configuration>
```

Your logback configuration file can also make use of System properties that the `LoggingSystem` takes care of creating for you:

- `${PID}`: The current process ID.
- `${LOG_FILE}`: Whether `logging.file.name` was set in Boot’s external configuration.
- `${LOG_PATH}`: Whether `logging.file.path` (representing a directory for log files to live in) was set in Boot’s external configuration.
- `${LOG_EXCEPTION_CONVERSION_WORD}`: Whether `logging.exception-conversion-word` was set in Boot’s external configuration.
- `${ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN}`: Whether `logging.pattern.rolling-file-name` was set in Boot’s external configuration.

Spring Boot also provides some nice ANSI color terminal output on a console (but not in a log file) by using a custom Logback converter. See the `CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN` in the `defaults.xml` configuration for an example.

If Groovy is on the classpath, you should be able to configure Logback with `logback.groovy` as well. If present, this setting is given preference.

|      | Spring extensions are not supported with Groovy configuration. Any `logback-spring.groovy` files will not be detected. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Configure Logback for File-only Output

If you want to disable console logging and write output only to a file, you need a custom `logback-spring.xml` that imports `file-appender.xml` but not `console-appender.xml`, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml" />
    <property name="LOG_FILE" value="${LOG_FILE:-${LOG_PATH:-${LOG_TEMP:-${java.io.tmpdir:-/tmp}}/}spring.log}"/>
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/file-appender.xml" />
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

You also need to add `logging.file.name` to your `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
logging.file.name=myapplication.log
```

#### 9.8.2. Configure Log4j for Logging

Spring Boot supports [Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) for logging configuration if it is on the classpath. If you use the starters for assembling dependencies, you have to exclude Logback and then include log4j 2 instead. If you do not use the starters, you need to provide (at least) `spring-jcl` in addition to Log4j 2.

The recommended path is through the starters, even though it requires some jiggling with excludes. The following example shows how to set up the starters in Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And the following example shows one way to set up the starters in Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-log4j2'
}

configurations {
    all {
        exclude group: 'org.springframework.boot', module: 'spring-boot-starter-logging'
    }
}
```

|      | The Log4j starters gather together the dependencies for common logging requirements (such as having Tomcat use `java.util.logging` but configuring the output using Log4j 2). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | To ensure that debug logging performed using `java.util.logging` is routed into Log4j 2, configure its [JDK logging adapter](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/log4j-jul/index.html) by setting the `java.util.logging.manager` system property to `org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Use YAML or JSON to Configure Log4j 2

In addition to its default XML configuration format, Log4j 2 also supports YAML and JSON configuration files. To configure Log4j 2 to use an alternative configuration file format, add the appropriate dependencies to the classpath and name your configuration files to match your chosen file format, as shown in the following example:

| Format | Dependencies                                                 | File names                   |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| YAML   | `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` + `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-yaml` | `log4j2.yaml` + `log4j2.yml` |
| JSON   | `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`                | `log4j2.json` + `log4j2.jsn` |

### 9.9. Data Access

Spring Boot includes a number of starters for working with data sources. This section answers questions related to doing so.

#### 9.9.1. Configure a Custom DataSource

To configure your own `DataSource`, define a `@Bean` of that type in your configuration. Spring Boot reuses your `DataSource` anywhere one is required, including database initialization. If you need to externalize some settings, you can bind your `DataSource` to the environment (see “[Third-party Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-3rd-party-configuration)”).

The following example shows how to define a data source in a bean:

```java
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="app.datasource")
public DataSource dataSource() {
    return new FancyDataSource();
}
```

The following example shows how to define a data source by setting properties:

```properties
app.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:mydb
app.datasource.username=sa
app.datasource.pool-size=30
```

Assuming that your `FancyDataSource` has regular JavaBean properties for the URL, the username, and the pool size, these settings are bound automatically before the `DataSource` is made available to other components. The regular [database initialization](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-jdbc) also happens (so the relevant sub-set of `spring.datasource.*` can still be used with your custom configuration).

Spring Boot also provides a utility builder class, called `DataSourceBuilder`, that can be used to create one of the standard data sources (if it is on the classpath). The builder can detect the one to use based on what’s available on the classpath. It also auto-detects the driver based on the JDBC URL.

The following example shows how to create a data source by using a `DataSourceBuilder`:

```java
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public DataSource dataSource() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
}
```

To run an app with that `DataSource`, all you need is the connection information. Pool-specific settings can also be provided. Check the implementation that is going to be used at runtime for more details.

The following example shows how to define a JDBC data source by setting properties:

```properties
app.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
app.datasource.username=dbuser
app.datasource.password=dbpass
app.datasource.pool-size=30
```

However, there is a catch. Because the actual type of the connection pool is not exposed, no keys are generated in the metadata for your custom `DataSource` and no completion is available in your IDE (because the `DataSource` interface exposes no properties). Also, if you happen to have Hikari on the classpath, this basic setup does not work, because Hikari has no `url` property (but does have a `jdbcUrl` property). In that case, you must rewrite your configuration as follows:

```properties
app.datasource.jdbc-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
app.datasource.username=dbuser
app.datasource.password=dbpass
app.datasource.maximum-pool-size=30
```

You can fix that by forcing the connection pool to use and return a dedicated implementation rather than `DataSource`. You cannot change the implementation at runtime, but the list of options will be explicit.

The following example shows how create a `HikariDataSource` with `DataSourceBuilder`:

```java
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public HikariDataSource dataSource() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
}
```

You can even go further by leveraging what `DataSourceProperties` does for you — that is, by providing a default embedded database with a sensible username and password if no URL is provided. You can easily initialize a `DataSourceBuilder` from the state of any `DataSourceProperties` object, so you could also inject the DataSource that Spring Boot creates automatically. However, that would split your configuration into two namespaces: `url`, `username`, `password`, `type`, and `driver` on `spring.datasource` and the rest on your custom namespace (`app.datasource`). To avoid that, you can redefine a custom `DataSourceProperties` on your custom namespace, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
@Primary
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public DataSourceProperties dataSourceProperties() {
    return new DataSourceProperties();
}

@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.configuration")
public HikariDataSource dataSource(DataSourceProperties properties) {
    return properties.initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
}
```

This setup puts you *in sync* with what Spring Boot does for you by default, except that a dedicated connection pool is chosen (in code) and its settings are exposed in the `app.datasource.configuration` sub namespace. Because `DataSourceProperties` is taking care of the `url`/`jdbcUrl` translation for you, you can configure it as follows:

```properties
app.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
app.datasource.username=dbuser
app.datasource.password=dbpass
app.datasource.configuration.maximum-pool-size=30
```

|      | Spring Boot will expose Hikari-specific settings to `spring.datasource.hikari`. This example uses a more generic `configuration` sub namespace as the example does not support multiple datasource implementations. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Because your custom configuration chooses to go with Hikari, `app.datasource.type` has no effect. In practice, the builder is initialized with whatever value you might set there and then overridden by the call to `.type()`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

See “[Configure a DataSource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-configure-datasource)” in the “Spring Boot features” section and the [`DataSourceAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jdbc/DataSourceAutoConfiguration.java) class for more details.

#### 9.9.2. Configure Two DataSources

If you need to configure multiple data sources, you can apply the same tricks that are described in the previous section. You must, however, mark one of the `DataSource` instances as `@Primary`, because various auto-configurations down the road expect to be able to get one by type.

If you create your own `DataSource`, the auto-configuration backs off. In the following example, we provide the *exact* same feature set as the auto-configuration provides on the primary data source:

```java
@Bean
@Primary
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.first")
public DataSourceProperties firstDataSourceProperties() {
    return new DataSourceProperties();
}

@Bean
@Primary
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.first.configuration")
public HikariDataSource firstDataSource() {
    return firstDataSourceProperties().initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
}

@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.second")
public BasicDataSource secondDataSource() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create().type(BasicDataSource.class).build();
}
```

|      | `firstDataSourceProperties` has to be flagged as `@Primary` so that the database initializer feature uses your copy (if you use the initializer). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Both data sources are also bound for advanced customizations. For instance, you could configure them as follows:

```properties
app.datasource.first.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/first
app.datasource.first.username=dbuser
app.datasource.first.password=dbpass
app.datasource.first.configuration.maximum-pool-size=30

app.datasource.second.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/second
app.datasource.second.username=dbuser
app.datasource.second.password=dbpass
app.datasource.second.max-total=30
```

You can apply the same concept to the secondary `DataSource` as well, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Bean
@Primary
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.first")
public DataSourceProperties firstDataSourceProperties() {
    return new DataSourceProperties();
}

@Bean
@Primary
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.first.configuration")
public HikariDataSource firstDataSource() {
    return firstDataSourceProperties().initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
}

@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.second")
public DataSourceProperties secondDataSourceProperties() {
    return new DataSourceProperties();
}

@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource.second.configuration")
public BasicDataSource secondDataSource() {
    return secondDataSourceProperties().initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(BasicDataSource.class).build();
}
```

The preceding example configures two data sources on custom namespaces with the same logic as Spring Boot would use in auto-configuration. Note that each `configuration` sub namespace provides advanced settings based on the chosen implementation.

#### 9.9.3. Use Spring Data Repositories

Spring Data can create implementations of `@Repository` interfaces of various flavors. Spring Boot handles all of that for you, as long as those `@Repositories` are included in the same package (or a sub-package) of your `@EnableAutoConfiguration` class.

For many applications, all you need is to put the right Spring Data dependencies on your classpath. There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` for JPA, `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` for Mongodb, etc. To get started, create some repository interfaces to handle your `@Entity` objects.

Spring Boot tries to guess the location of your `@Repository` definitions, based on the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` it finds. To get more control, use the `@EnableJpaRepositories` annotation (from Spring Data JPA).

For more about Spring Data, see the [Spring Data project page](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data).

#### 9.9.4. Separate @Entity Definitions from Spring Configuration

Spring Boot tries to guess the location of your `@Entity` definitions, based on the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` it finds. To get more control, you can use the `@EntityScan` annotation, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EntityScan(basePackageClasses=City.class)
public class Application {

    //...

}
```

#### 9.9.5. Configure JPA Properties

Spring Data JPA already provides some vendor-independent configuration options (such as those for SQL logging), and Spring Boot exposes those options and a few more for Hibernate as external configuration properties. Some of them are automatically detected according to the context so you should not have to set them.

The `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is a special case, because, depending on runtime conditions, it has different defaults. If an embedded database is used and no schema manager (such as Liquibase or Flyway) is handling the `DataSource`, it defaults to `create-drop`. In all other cases, it defaults to `none`.

The dialect to use is detected by the JPA provider. If you prefer to set the dialect yourself, set the `spring.jpa.database-platform` property.

The most common options to set are shown in the following example:

```
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=com.example.MyPhysicalNamingStrategy
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

In addition, all properties in `spring.jpa.properties.*` are passed through as normal JPA properties (with the prefix stripped) when the local `EntityManagerFactory` is created.

|      | You need to ensure that names defined under `spring.jpa.properties.*` exactly match those expected by your JPA provider. Spring Boot will not attempt any kind of relaxed binding for these entries.For example, if you want to configure Hibernate’s batch size you must use `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size`. If you use other forms, such as `batchSize` or `batch-size`, Hibernate will not apply the setting. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | If you need to apply advanced customization to Hibernate properties, consider registering a `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` bean that will be invoked prior to creating the `EntityManagerFactory`. This takes precedence to anything that is applied by the auto-configuration. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.9.6. Configure Hibernate Naming Strategy

Hibernate uses [two different naming strategies](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#naming) to map names from the object model to the corresponding database names. The fully qualified class name of the physical and the implicit strategy implementations can be configured by setting the `spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy` and `spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.implicit-strategy` properties, respectively. Alternatively, if `ImplicitNamingStrategy` or `PhysicalNamingStrategy` beans are available in the application context, Hibernate will be automatically configured to use them.

By default, Spring Boot configures the physical naming strategy with `SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy`. This implementation provides the same table structure as Hibernate 4: all dots are replaced by underscores and camel casing is replaced by underscores as well. By default, all table names are generated in lower case, but it is possible to override that flag if your schema requires it.

For example, a `TelephoneNumber` entity is mapped to the `telephone_number` table.

If you prefer to use Hibernate 5’s default instead, set the following property:

```
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
```

Alternatively, you can configure the following bean:

```java
@Bean
public PhysicalNamingStrategy physicalNamingStrategy() {
    return new PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl();
}
```

See [`HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration.java) and [`JpaBaseConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/JpaBaseConfiguration.java) for more details.

#### 9.9.7. Configure Hibernate Second-Level Caching

Hibernate [second-level cache](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching) can be configured for a range of cache providers. Rather than configuring Hibernate to lookup the cache provider again, it is better to provide the one that is available in the context whenever possible.

To do this with JCache, first make sure that `org.hibernate:hibernate-jcache` is available on the classpath. Then, add a `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` bean as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class HibernateSecondLevelCacheExample {

    @Bean
    public HibernatePropertiesCustomizer hibernateSecondLevelCacheCustomizer(JCacheCacheManager cacheManager) {
        return (properties) -> properties.put(ConfigSettings.CACHE_MANAGER, cacheManager.getCacheManager());
    }

}
```

This customizer will configure Hibernate to use the same `CacheManager` as the one that the application uses. It is also possible to use separate `CacheManager` instances. For details, refer to [the Hibernate user guide](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching-provider-jcache).

#### 9.9.8. Use Dependency Injection in Hibernate Components

By default, Spring Boot registers a `BeanContainer` implementation that uses the `BeanFactory` so that converters and entity listeners can use regular dependency injection.

You can disable or tune this behaviour by registering a `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` that removes or changes the `hibernate.resource.beans.container` property.

#### 9.9.9. Use a Custom EntityManagerFactory

To take full control of the configuration of the `EntityManagerFactory`, you need to add a `@Bean` named ‘entityManagerFactory’. Spring Boot auto-configuration switches off its entity manager in the presence of a bean of that type.

#### 9.9.10. Use Two EntityManagers

Even if the default `EntityManagerFactory` works fine, you need to define a new one, otherwise the presence of the second bean of that type switches off the default. You can use the `EntityManagerBuilder` provided by Spring Boot to help you to create one. Alternatively, you can use the `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` directly from Spring ORM, as shown in the following example:

```java
// add two data sources configured as above

@Bean
public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean customerEntityManagerFactory(
        EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder) {
    return builder
            .dataSource(customerDataSource())
            .packages(Customer.class)
            .persistenceUnit("customers")
            .build();
}

@Bean
public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean orderEntityManagerFactory(
        EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder) {
    return builder
            .dataSource(orderDataSource())
            .packages(Order.class)
            .persistenceUnit("orders")
            .build();
}
```

|      | When you create a bean for `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` yourself, any customization that was applied during the creation of the auto-configured `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` is lost. For example, in case of Hibernate, any properties under the `spring.jpa.hibernate` prefix will not be automatically applied to your `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean`. If you were relying on these properties for configuring things like the naming strategy or the DDL mode, you will need to explicitly configure that when creating the `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` bean. On the other hand, properties that get applied to the auto-configured `EntityManagerFactoryBuilder`, which are specified via `spring.jpa.properties`, will automatically be applied, provided you use the auto-configured `EntityManagerFactoryBuilder` to build the `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` bean. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The configuration above almost works on its own. To complete the picture, you need to configure `TransactionManagers` for the two `EntityManagers` as well. If you mark one of them as `@Primary`, it could be picked up by the default `JpaTransactionManager` in Spring Boot. The other would have to be explicitly injected into a new instance. Alternatively, you might be able to use a JTA transaction manager that spans both.

If you use Spring Data, you need to configure `@EnableJpaRepositories` accordingly, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackageClasses = Customer.class,
        entityManagerFactoryRef = "customerEntityManagerFactory")
public class CustomerConfiguration {
    ...
}

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackageClasses = Order.class,
        entityManagerFactoryRef = "orderEntityManagerFactory")
public class OrderConfiguration {
    ...
}
```

#### 9.9.11. Use a Traditional `persistence.xml` File

Spring Boot will not search for or use a `META-INF/persistence.xml` by default. If you prefer to use a traditional `persistence.xml`, you need to define your own `@Bean` of type `LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean` (with an ID of ‘entityManagerFactory’) and set the persistence unit name there.

See [`JpaBaseConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/JpaBaseConfiguration.java) for the default settings.

#### 9.9.12. Use Spring Data JPA and Mongo Repositories

Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Mongo can both automatically create `Repository` implementations for you. If they are both present on the classpath, you might have to do some extra configuration to tell Spring Boot which repositories to create. The most explicit way to do that is to use the standard Spring Data `@EnableJpaRepositories` and `@EnableMongoRepositories` annotations and provide the location of your `Repository` interfaces.

There are also flags (`spring.data.*.repositories.enabled` and `spring.data.*.repositories.type`) that you can use to switch the auto-configured repositories on and off in external configuration. Doing so is useful, for instance, in case you want to switch off the Mongo repositories and still use the auto-configured `MongoTemplate`.

The same obstacle and the same features exist for other auto-configured Spring Data repository types (Elasticsearch, Solr, and others). To work with them, change the names of the annotations and flags accordingly.

#### 9.9.13. Customize Spring Data’s Web Support

Spring Data provides web support that simplifies the use of Spring Data repositories in a web application. Spring Boot provides properties in the `spring.data.web` namespace for customizing its configuration. Note that if you are using Spring Data REST, you must use the properties in the `spring.data.rest` namespace instead.

#### 9.9.14. Expose Spring Data Repositories as REST Endpoint

Spring Data REST can expose the `Repository` implementations as REST endpoints for you, provided Spring MVC has been enabled for the application.

Spring Boot exposes a set of useful properties (from the `spring.data.rest` namespace) that customize the [`RepositoryRestConfiguration`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/3.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/rest/core/config/RepositoryRestConfiguration.html). If you need to provide additional customization, you should use a [`RepositoryRestConfigurer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/3.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/data/rest/webmvc/config/RepositoryRestConfigurer.html) bean.

|      | If you do not specify any order on your custom `RepositoryRestConfigurer`, it runs after the one Spring Boot uses internally. If you need to specify an order, make sure it is higher than 0. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.9.15. Configure a Component that is Used by JPA

If you want to configure a component that JPA uses, then you need to ensure that the component is initialized before JPA. When the component is auto-configured, Spring Boot takes care of this for you. For example, when Flyway is auto-configured, Hibernate is configured to depend upon Flyway so that Flyway has a chance to initialize the database before Hibernate tries to use it.

If you are configuring a component yourself, you can use an `EntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor` subclass as a convenient way of setting up the necessary dependencies. For example, if you use Hibernate Search with Elasticsearch as its index manager, any `EntityManagerFactory` beans must be configured to depend on the `elasticsearchClient` bean, as shown in the following example:

```java
/**
 * {@link EntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor} that ensures that
 * {@link EntityManagerFactory} beans depend on the {@code elasticsearchClient} bean.
 */
@Component
static class ElasticsearchEntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor
        extends EntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor {

    ElasticsearchEntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor() {
        super("elasticsearchClient");
    }

}
```

#### 9.9.16. Configure jOOQ with Two DataSources

If you need to use jOOQ with multiple data sources, you should create your own `DSLContext` for each one. Refer to [JooqAutoConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jooq/JooqAutoConfiguration.java) for more details.

|      | In particular, `JooqExceptionTranslator` and `SpringTransactionProvider` can be reused to provide similar features to what the auto-configuration does with a single `DataSource`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

### 9.10. Database Initialization

An SQL database can be initialized in different ways depending on what your stack is. Of course, you can also do it manually, provided the database is a separate process. It is recommended to use a single mechanism for schema generation.

#### 9.10.1. Initialize a Database Using JPA

JPA has features for DDL generation, and these can be set up to run on startup against the database. This is controlled through two external properties:

- `spring.jpa.generate-ddl` (boolean) switches the feature on and off and is vendor independent.
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` (enum) is a Hibernate feature that controls the behavior in a more fine-grained way. This feature is described in more detail later in this guide.

#### 9.10.2. Initialize a Database Using Hibernate

You can set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` explicitly and the standard Hibernate property values are `none`, `validate`, `update`, `create`, and `create-drop`. Spring Boot chooses a default value for you based on whether it thinks your database is embedded. It defaults to `create-drop` if no schema manager has been detected or `none` in all other cases. An embedded database is detected by looking at the `Connection` type. `hsqldb`, `h2`, and `derby` are embedded, and others are not. Be careful when switching from in-memory to a ‘real’ database that you do not make assumptions about the existence of the tables and data in the new platform. You either have to set `ddl-auto` explicitly or use one of the other mechanisms to initialize the database.

|      | You can output the schema creation by enabling the `org.hibernate.SQL` logger. This is done for you automatically if you enable the [debug mode](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-logging-console-output). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

In addition, a file named `import.sql` in the root of the classpath is executed on startup if Hibernate creates the schema from scratch (that is, if the `ddl-auto` property is set to `create` or `create-drop`). This can be useful for demos and for testing if you are careful but is probably not something you want to be on the classpath in production. It is a Hibernate feature (and has nothing to do with Spring).

#### 9.10.3. Initialize a Database

Spring Boot can automatically create the schema (DDL scripts) of your `DataSource` and initialize it (DML scripts). It loads SQL from the standard root classpath locations: `schema.sql` and `data.sql`, respectively. In addition, Spring Boot processes the `schema-${platform}.sql` and `data-${platform}.sql` files (if present), where `platform` is the value of `spring.datasource.platform`. This allows you to switch to database-specific scripts if necessary. For example, you might choose to set it to the vendor name of the database (`hsqldb`, `h2`, `oracle`, `mysql`, `postgresql`, and so on).

|      | When only basic SQL scripts are used, Spring Boot automatically creates the schema of an embedded `DataSource`. This behavior can be customized by using the `spring.datasource.initialization-mode` property. For instance, if you want to always initialize the `DataSource` regardless of its type:`spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always`In a JPA-based app, you can choose to let Hibernate create the schema or use `schema.sql`, but you cannot do both. Make sure to disable `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` if you use `schema.sql`.`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none`If you are using a [Higher-level Database Migration Tool](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-a-higher-level-database-migration-tool), like Flyway or Liquibase, you cannot use basic SQL scripts to create and initialize the schema. In this situation, if `schema.sql` and `data.sql` are present, they will be ignored. It is not possible to use a Database Migration Tool to manage schema creation, and a basic SQL script to initialize it. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, Spring Boot enables the fail-fast feature of the Spring JDBC initializer. This means that, if the scripts cause exceptions, the application fails to start. You can tune that behavior by setting `spring.datasource.continue-on-error`.

#### 9.10.4. Initialize a Spring Batch Database

If you use Spring Batch, it comes pre-packaged with SQL initialization scripts for most popular database platforms. Spring Boot can detect your database type and execute those scripts on startup. If you use an embedded database, this happens by default. You can also enable it for any database type, as shown in the following example:

```
spring.batch.initialize-schema=always
```

You can also switch off the initialization explicitly by setting `spring.batch.initialize-schema=never`.

#### 9.10.5. Use a Higher-level Database Migration Tool

Spring Boot supports two higher-level migration tools: [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) and [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/).

##### Execute Flyway Database Migrations on Startup

To automatically run Flyway database migrations on startup, add the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` to your classpath.

Typically, migrations are scripts in the form `V__.sql` (with `` an underscore-separated version, such as ‘1’ or ‘2_1’). By default, they are in a folder called `classpath:db/migration`, but you can modify that location by setting `spring.flyway.locations`. This is a comma-separated list of one or more `classpath:` or `filesystem:` locations. For example, the following configuration would search for scripts in both the default classpath location and the `/opt/migration` directory:

```properties
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration,filesystem:/opt/migration
```

You can also add a special `{vendor}` placeholder to use vendor-specific scripts. Assume the following:

```properties
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration/{vendor}
```

Rather than using `db/migration`, the preceding configuration sets the folder to use according to the type of the database (such as `db/migration/mysql` for MySQL). The list of supported databases is available in [`DatabaseDriver`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/jdbc/DatabaseDriver.java).

Migrations can also be written in Java. Flyway will be auto-configured with any beans that implement `JavaMigration`.

[`FlywayProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/flyway/FlywayProperties.java) provides most of Flyway’s settings and a small set of additional properties that can be used to disable the migrations or switch off the location checking. If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering a `FlywayConfigurationCustomizer` bean.

Spring Boot calls `Flyway.migrate()` to perform the database migration. If you would like more control, provide a `@Bean` that implements [`FlywayMigrationStrategy`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/flyway/FlywayMigrationStrategy.java).

Flyway supports SQL and Java [callbacks](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/callbacks.html). To use SQL-based callbacks, place the callback scripts in the `classpath:db/migration` folder. To use Java-based callbacks, create one or more beans that implement `Callback`. Any such beans are automatically registered with `Flyway`. They can be ordered by using `@Order` or by implementing `Ordered`. Beans that implement the deprecated `FlywayCallback` interface can also be detected, however they cannot be used alongside `Callback` beans.

By default, Flyway autowires the (`@Primary`) `DataSource` in your context and uses that for migrations. If you like to use a different `DataSource`, you can create one and mark its `@Bean` as `@FlywayDataSource`. If you do so and want two data sources, remember to create another one and mark it as `@Primary`. Alternatively, you can use Flyway’s native `DataSource` by setting `spring.flyway.[url,user,password]` in external properties. Setting either `spring.flyway.url` or `spring.flyway.user` is sufficient to cause Flyway to use its own `DataSource`. If any of the three properties has not been set, the value of its equivalent `spring.datasource` property will be used.

You can also use Flyway to provide data for specific scenarios. For example, you can place test-specific migrations in `src/test/resources` and they are run only when your application starts for testing. Also, you can use profile-specific configuration to customize `spring.flyway.locations` so that certain migrations run only when a particular profile is active. For example, in `application-dev.properties`, you might specify the following setting:

```properties
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:/db/migration,classpath:/dev/db/migration
```

With that setup, migrations in `dev/db/migration` run only when the `dev` profile is active.

##### Execute Liquibase Database Migrations on Startup

To automatically run Liquibase database migrations on startup, add the `org.liquibase:liquibase-core` to your classpath.

|      | When you add the `org.liquibase:liquibase-core` to your classpath, database migrations run by default for both during application startup and before your tests run. This behavior can be customized by using the `spring.liquibase.enabled` property, setting different values in the `main` and `test` configurations. It is not possible to use two different ways to initialize the database (e.g. Liquibase for application startup, JPA for test runs). |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

By default, the master change log is read from `db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml`, but you can change the location by setting `spring.liquibase.change-log`. In addition to YAML, Liquibase also supports JSON, XML, and SQL change log formats.

By default, Liquibase autowires the (`@Primary`) `DataSource` in your context and uses that for migrations. If you need to use a different `DataSource`, you can create one and mark its `@Bean` as `@LiquibaseDataSource`. If you do so and you want two data sources, remember to create another one and mark it as `@Primary`. Alternatively, you can use Liquibase’s native `DataSource` by setting `spring.liquibase.[url,user,password]` in external properties. Setting either `spring.liquibase.url` or `spring.liquibase.user` is sufficient to cause Liquibase to use its own `DataSource`. If any of the three properties has not been set, the value of its equivalent `spring.datasource` property will be used.

See [`LiquibaseProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/liquibase/LiquibaseProperties.java) for details about available settings such as contexts, the default schema, and others.

### 9.11. Messaging

Spring Boot offers a number of starters that include messaging. This section answers questions that arise from using messaging with Spring Boot.

#### 9.11.1. Disable Transacted JMS Session

If your JMS broker does not support transacted sessions, you have to disable the support of transactions altogether. If you create your own `JmsListenerContainerFactory`, there is nothing to do, since, by default it cannot be transacted. If you want to use the `DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer` to reuse Spring Boot’s default, you can disable transacted sessions, as follows:

```java
@Bean
public DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory jmsListenerContainerFactory(
        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory,
        DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer) {
    DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory listenerFactory =
            new DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory();
    configurer.configure(listenerFactory, connectionFactory);
    listenerFactory.setTransactionManager(null);
    listenerFactory.setSessionTransacted(false);
    return listenerFactory;
}
```

The preceding example overrides the default factory, and it should be applied to any other factory that your application defines, if any.

### 9.12. Batch Applications

A number of questions often arise when people use Spring Batch from within a Spring Boot application. This section addresses those questions.

#### 9.12.1. Specifying a Batch Data Source

By default, batch applications require a `DataSource` to store job details. Spring Batch expects a single `DataSource` by default. To have it use a `DataSource` other than the application’s main `DataSource`, declare a `DataSource` bean, annotating its `@Bean` method with `@BatchDataSource`. If you do so and want two data sources, remember to mark the other one `@Primary`. To take greater control, implement `BatchConfigurer`. See [The Javadoc of `@EnableBatchProcessing`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/batch/core/configuration/annotation/EnableBatchProcessing.html) for more details.

For more info about Spring Batch, see the [Spring Batch project page](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch).

#### 9.12.2. Running Spring Batch Jobs on Startup

Spring Batch auto-configuration is enabled by adding `@EnableBatchProcessing` to one of your `@Configuration` classes.

By default, it executes **all** `Jobs` in the application context on startup (see [`JobLauncherCommandLineRunner`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/batch/JobLauncherCommandLineRunner.java) for details). You can narrow down to a specific job or jobs by specifying `spring.batch.job.names` (which takes a comma-separated list of job name patterns).

See [BatchAutoConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/batch/BatchAutoConfiguration.java) and [@EnableBatchProcessing](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/batch/core/configuration/annotation/EnableBatchProcessing.html) for more details.

#### 9.12.3. Running from the Command Line

Running Spring Batch with Spring Boot from the command line differs from running Spring Batch by itself from the command line. The most important difference is that they parse command line arguments differently, which can cause trouble, as described in the next section.

##### Passing Command-line Arguments

Spring Boot converts any command line argument starting with `--` to a property to add to the `Environment`, see [accessing command line properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-command-line-args). This should not be used to pass arguments to batch jobs. To specify batch arguments on the command line, use the regular format (i.e. without `--`), as shown in the following example:

```
$ java -jar myapp.jar someParameter=someValue anotherParameter=anotherValue
```

If you specify a property of the `Environment` on the command line, it impacts the arguments that your job uses as well. Consider the following command:

```
$ java -jar myapp.jar --server.port=7070 someParameter=someValue
```

This provides two arguments to the batch job: `someParameter=someValue` and `-server.port=7070`. Note that the second argument is missing one hyphen as Spring Batch will remove the first `-` character of a property if it is present.

#### 9.12.4. Storing the Job Repository

Spring Batch requires a data store for the `Job` repository. If you use Spring Boot, you must use an actual database. Note that it can be an in-memory database, see [Configuring a Job Repository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/reference/html/job.html#configuringJobRepository).

### 9.13. Actuator

Spring Boot includes the Spring Boot Actuator. This section answers questions that often arise from its use.

#### 9.13.1. Change the HTTP Port or Address of the Actuator Endpoints

In a standalone application, the Actuator HTTP port defaults to the same as the main HTTP port. To make the application listen on a different port, set the external property: `management.server.port`. To listen on a completely different network address (such as when you have an internal network for management and an external one for user applications), you can also set `management.server.address` to a valid IP address to which the server is able to bind.

For more detail, see the [`ManagementServerProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/web/server/ManagementServerProperties.java) source code and “[Customizing the Management Server Port](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-customizing-management-server-port)” in the “Production-ready features” section.

#### 9.13.2. Customize the ‘whitelabel’ Error Page

Spring Boot installs a ‘whitelabel’ error page that you see in a browser client if you encounter a server error (machine clients consuming JSON and other media types should see a sensible response with the right error code).

|      | Set `server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false` to switch the default error page off. Doing so restores the default of the servlet container that you are using. Note that Spring Boot still tries to resolve the error view, so you should probably add your own error page rather than disabling it completely. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Overriding the error page with your own depends on the templating technology that you use. For example, if you use Thymeleaf, you can add an `error.html` template. If you use FreeMarker, you can add an `error.ftlh` template. In general, you need a `View` that resolves with a name of `error` or a `@Controller` that handles the `/error` path. Unless you replaced some of the default configuration, you should find a `BeanNameViewResolver` in your `ApplicationContext`, so a `@Bean` named `error` would be one way of doing that. See [`ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/servlet/error/ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration.java) for more options.

See also the section on “[Error Handling](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-error-handling)” for details of how to register handlers in the servlet container.

#### 9.13.3. Sanitize Sensitive Values

Information returned by the `env` and `configprops` endpoints can be somewhat sensitive so keys matching a certain pattern are sanitized by default (i.e. their values are replaced by `******`).

The patterns to use can be customized using the `management.endpoint.env.keys-to-sanitize` and `management.endpoint.configprops.keys-to-sanitize` respectively.

Spring Boot uses sensible defaults for such keys: any key ending with the word "password", "secret", "key", "token", "vcap_services", "sun.java.command", "uri", "uris", "address" or "addresses" is sanitized. Additionally, any key that holds the word `credentials` as part of the key is sanitized (configured as a regular expression, i.e. `*credentials.*`).

If any of the keys to sanitize are URI format (i.e. `://:@:/`), only the password part is sanitized.

#### 9.13.4. Map Health Indicators to Micrometer Metrics

Spring Boot health indicators return a `Status` type to indicate the overall system health. If you want to monitor or alert on levels of health for a particular application, you can export these statuses as metrics via Micrometer. By default, the status codes “up”, “down”, “out of service” and “unknown” are used by Spring Boot. To export these, you’ll need to convert these states to some set of numbers so that they can be used with a Micrometer `Gauge`.

The follow example shows one way to write such an exporter:

```java
@Configuration
public class HealthMetricsConfiguration {

    public HealthMetricsConfiguration(MeterRegistry registry, HealthEndpoint healthEndpoint) {
        // This example presumes common tags (such as the app) are applied elsewhere
        Gauge.builder("health", healthEndpoint, this::getStatusCode).strongReference(true).register(registry);
    }

    private int getStatusCode(HealthEndpoint health) {
        Status status = health.health().getStatus();
        if (Status.UP.equals(status)) {
            return 3;
        }
        if (Status.OUT_OF_SERVICE.equals(status)) {
            return 2;
        }
        if (Status.DOWN.equals(status)) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }

}
```

### 9.14. Security

This section addresses questions about security when working with Spring Boot, including questions that arise from using Spring Security with Spring Boot.

For more about Spring Security, see the [Spring Security project page](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security).

#### 9.14.1. Switch off the Spring Boot Security Configuration

If you define a `@Configuration` with a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` in your application, it switches off the default webapp security settings in Spring Boot.

#### 9.14.2. Change the UserDetailsService and Add User Accounts

If you provide a `@Bean` of type `AuthenticationManager`, `AuthenticationProvider`, or `UserDetailsService`, the default `@Bean` for `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` is not created. This means you have the full feature set of Spring Security available (such as [various authentication options](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-authentication)).

The easiest way to add user accounts is to provide your own `UserDetailsService` bean.

#### 9.14.3. Enable HTTPS When Running behind a Proxy Server

Ensuring that all your main endpoints are only available over HTTPS is an important chore for any application. If you use Tomcat as a servlet container, then Spring Boot adds Tomcat’s own `RemoteIpValve` automatically if it detects some environment settings, and you should be able to rely on the `HttpServletRequest` to report whether it is secure or not (even downstream of a proxy server that handles the real SSL termination). The standard behavior is determined by the presence or absence of certain request headers (`x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto`), whose names are conventional, so it should work with most front-end proxies. You can switch on the valve by adding some entries to `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

```properties
server.tomcat.remote-ip-header=x-forwarded-for
server.tomcat.protocol-header=x-forwarded-proto
```

(The presence of either of those properties switches on the valve. Alternatively, you can add the `RemoteIpValve` by adding a `TomcatServletWebServerFactory` bean.)

To configure Spring Security to require a secure channel for all (or some) requests, consider adding your own `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` that adds the following `HttpSecurity` configuration:

```java
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class SslWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // Customize the application security
        http.requiresChannel().anyRequest().requiresSecure();
    }

}
```

### 9.15. Hot Swapping

Spring Boot supports hot swapping. This section answers questions about how it works.

#### 9.15.1. Reload Static Content

There are several options for hot reloading. The recommended approach is to use [`spring-boot-devtools`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools), as it provides additional development-time features, such as support for fast application restarts and LiveReload as well as sensible development-time configuration (such as template caching). Devtools works by monitoring the classpath for changes. This means that static resource changes must be "built" for the change to take effect. By default, this happens automatically in Eclipse when you save your changes. In IntelliJ IDEA, the Make Project command triggers the necessary build. Due to the [default restart exclusions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-restart-exclude), changes to static resources do not trigger a restart of your application. They do, however, trigger a live reload.

Alternatively, running in an IDE (especially with debugging on) is a good way to do development (all modern IDEs allow reloading of static resources and usually also allow hot-swapping of Java class changes).

Finally, the [Maven and Gradle plugins](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins) can be configured (see the `addResources` property) to support running from the command line with reloading of static files directly from source. You can use that with an external css/js compiler process if you are writing that code with higher-level tools.

#### 9.15.2. Reload Templates without Restarting the Container

Most of the templating technologies supported by Spring Boot include a configuration option to disable caching (described later in this document). If you use the `spring-boot-devtools` module, these properties are [automatically configured](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-property-defaults) for you at development time.

##### Thymeleaf Templates

If you use Thymeleaf, set `spring.thymeleaf.cache` to `false`. See [`ThymeleafAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/thymeleaf/ThymeleafAutoConfiguration.java) for other Thymeleaf customization options.

##### FreeMarker Templates

If you use FreeMarker, set `spring.freemarker.cache` to `false`. See [`FreeMarkerAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/freemarker/FreeMarkerAutoConfiguration.java) for other FreeMarker customization options.

##### Groovy Templates

If you use Groovy templates, set `spring.groovy.template.cache` to `false`. See [`GroovyTemplateAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/groovy/template/GroovyTemplateAutoConfiguration.java) for other Groovy customization options.

#### 9.15.3. Fast Application Restarts

The `spring-boot-devtools` module includes support for automatic application restarts. While not as fast as technologies such as [JRebel](https://www.jrebel.com/products/jrebel) it is usually significantly faster than a “cold start”. You should probably give it a try before investigating some of the more complex reload options discussed later in this document.

For more details, see the [Developer Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools) section.

#### 9.15.4. Reload Java Classes without Restarting the Container

Many modern IDEs (Eclipse, IDEA, and others) support hot swapping of bytecode. Consequently, if you make a change that does not affect class or method signatures, it should reload cleanly with no side effects.

### 9.16. Build

Spring Boot includes build plugins for Maven and Gradle. This section answers common questions about these plugins.

#### 9.16.1. Generate Build Information

Both the Maven plugin and the Gradle plugin allow generating build information containing the coordinates, name, and version of the project. The plugins can also be configured to add additional properties through configuration. When such a file is present, Spring Boot auto-configures a `BuildProperties` bean.

To generate build information with Maven, add an execution for the `build-info` goal, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>build-info</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

|      | See the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin/) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following example does the same with Gradle:

```groovy
springBoot {
    buildInfo()
}
```

|      | See the [Spring Boot Gradle Plugin documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html//#integrating-with-actuator-build-info) for more details. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.16.2. Generate Git Information

Both Maven and Gradle allow generating a `git.properties` file containing information about the state of your `git` source code repository when the project was built.

For Maven users, the `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM includes a pre-configured plugin to generate a `git.properties` file. To use it, add the following declaration to your POM:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>pl.project13.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>git-commit-id-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

Gradle users can achieve the same result by using the [`gradle-git-properties`](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties) plugin, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties" version "2.2.2"
}
```

|      | The commit time in `git.properties` is expected to match the following format: `yyyy-MM-dd’T’HH:mm:ssZ`. This is the default format for both plugins listed above. Using this format lets the time be parsed into a `Date` and its format, when serialized to JSON, to be controlled by Jackson’s date serialization configuration settings. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 9.16.3. Customize Dependency Versions

If you use a Maven build that inherits directly or indirectly from `spring-boot-dependencies` (for instance, `spring-boot-starter-parent`) but you want to override a specific third-party dependency, you can add appropriate `` elements. Browse the [`spring-boot-dependencies`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/pom.xml) POM for a complete list of properties. For example, to pick a different `slf4j` version, you would add the following property:

```xml
<properties>
    <slf4j.version>1.7.5<slf4j.version>
</properties>
```

|      | Doing so only works if your Maven project inherits (directly or indirectly) from `spring-boot-dependencies`. If you have added `spring-boot-dependencies` in your own `dependencyManagement` section with `import`, you have to redefine the artifact yourself instead of overriding the property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

|      | Each Spring Boot release is designed and tested against this specific set of third-party dependencies. Overriding versions may cause compatibility issues. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

To override dependency versions in Gradle, see [this section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html//#managing-dependencies-customizing) of the Gradle plugin’s documentation.

#### 9.16.4. Create an Executable JAR with Maven

The `spring-boot-maven-plugin` can be used to create an executable “fat” JAR. If you use the `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM, you can declare the plugin and your jars are repackaged as follows:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

If you do not use the parent POM, you can still use the plugin. However, you must additionally add an `` section, as follows:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.9.RELEASE</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>repackage</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

See the [plugin documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin//usage.html) for full usage details.

#### 9.16.5. Use a Spring Boot Application as a Dependency

Like a war file, a Spring Boot application is not intended to be used as a dependency. If your application contains classes that you want to share with other projects, the recommended approach is to move that code into a separate module. The separate module can then be depended upon by your application and other projects.

If you cannot rearrange your code as recommended above, Spring Boot’s Maven and Gradle plugins must be configured to produce a separate artifact that is suitable for use as a dependency. The executable archive cannot be used as a dependency as the [executable jar format](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#executable-jar-jar-file-structure) packages application classes in `BOOT-INF/classes`. This means that they cannot be found when the executable jar is used as a dependency.

To produce the two artifacts, one that can be used as a dependency and one that is executable, a classifier must be specified. This classifier is applied to the name of the executable archive, leaving the default archive for use as a dependency.

To configure a classifier of `exec` in Maven, you can use the following configuration:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <classifier>exec</classifier>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### 9.16.6. Extract Specific Libraries When an Executable Jar Runs

Most nested libraries in an executable jar do not need to be unpacked in order to run. However, certain libraries can have problems. For example, JRuby includes its own nested jar support, which assumes that the `jruby-complete.jar` is always directly available as a file in its own right.

To deal with any problematic libraries, you can flag that specific nested jars should be automatically unpacked when the executable jar first runs. Such nested jars are written beneath the temporary directory identified by the `java.io.tmpdir` system property.

|      | Care should be taken to ensure that your operating system is configured so that it will not delete the jars that have been unpacked to the temporary directory while the application is still running. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

For example, to indicate that JRuby should be flagged for unpacking by using the Maven Plugin, you would add the following configuration:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <requiresUnpack>
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
                        <artifactId>jruby-complete</artifactId>
                    </dependency>
                </requiresUnpack>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### 9.16.7. Create a Non-executable JAR with Exclusions

Often, if you have an executable and a non-executable jar as two separate build products, the executable version has additional configuration files that are not needed in a library jar. For example, the `application.yml` configuration file might be excluded from the non-executable JAR.

In Maven, the executable jar must be the main artifact and you can add a classified jar for the library, as follows:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>lib</id>
                    <phase>package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>jar</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <classifier>lib</classifier>
                        <excludes>
                            <exclude>application.yml</exclude>
                        </excludes>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### 9.16.8. Remote Debug a Spring Boot Application Started with Maven

To attach a remote debugger to a Spring Boot application that was started with Maven, you can use the `jvmArguments` property of the [maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin/).

See [this example](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/maven-plugin//examples/run-debug.html) for more details.

#### 9.16.9. Build an Executable Archive from Ant without Using `spring-boot-antlib`

To build with Ant, you need to grab dependencies, compile, and then create a jar or war archive. To make it executable, you can either use the `spring-boot-antlib` module or you can follow these instructions:

1. If you are building a jar, package the application’s classes and resources in a nested `BOOT-INF/classes` directory. If you are building a war, package the application’s classes in a nested `WEB-INF/classes` directory as usual.
2. Add the runtime dependencies in a nested `BOOT-INF/lib` directory for a jar or `WEB-INF/lib` for a war. Remember **not** to compress the entries in the archive.
3. Add the `provided` (embedded container) dependencies in a nested `BOOT-INF/lib` directory for a jar or `WEB-INF/lib-provided` for a war. Remember **not** to compress the entries in the archive.
4. Add the `spring-boot-loader` classes at the root of the archive (so that the `Main-Class` is available).
5. Use the appropriate launcher (such as `JarLauncher` for a jar file) as a `Main-Class` attribute in the manifest and specify the other properties it needs as manifest entries — principally, by setting a `Start-Class` property.

The following example shows how to build an executable archive with Ant:

```xml
<target name="build" depends="compile">
    <jar destfile="target/${ant.project.name}-${spring-boot.version}.jar" compress="false">
        <mappedresources>
            <fileset dir="target/classes" />
            <globmapper from="*" to="BOOT-INF/classes/*"/>
        </mappedresources>
        <mappedresources>
            <fileset dir="src/main/resources" erroronmissingdir="false"/>
            <globmapper from="*" to="BOOT-INF/classes/*"/>
        </mappedresources>
        <mappedresources>
            <fileset dir="${lib.dir}/runtime" />
            <globmapper from="*" to="BOOT-INF/lib/*"/>
        </mappedresources>
        <zipfileset src="${lib.dir}/loader/spring-boot-loader-jar-${spring-boot.version}.jar" />
        <manifest>
            <attribute name="Main-Class" value="org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher" />
            <attribute name="Start-Class" value="${start-class}" />
        </manifest>
    </jar>
</target>
```

### 9.17. Traditional Deployment

Spring Boot supports traditional deployment as well as more modern forms of deployment. This section answers common questions about traditional deployment.

#### 9.17.1. Create a Deployable War File

|      | Because Spring WebFlux does not strictly depend on the Servlet API and applications are deployed by default on an embedded Reactor Netty server, War deployment is not supported for WebFlux applications. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The first step in producing a deployable war file is to provide a `SpringBootServletInitializer` subclass and override its `configure` method. Doing so makes use of Spring Framework’s Servlet 3.0 support and lets you configure your application when it is launched by the servlet container. Typically, you should update your application’s main class to extend `SpringBootServletInitializer`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {
        return application.sources(Application.class);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

The next step is to update your build configuration such that your project produces a war file rather than a jar file. If you use Maven and `spring-boot-starter-parent` (which configures Maven’s war plugin for you), all you need to do is to modify `pom.xml` to change the packaging to war, as follows:

```xml
<packaging>war</packaging>
```

If you use Gradle, you need to modify `build.gradle` to apply the war plugin to the project, as follows:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'war'
```

The final step in the process is to ensure that the embedded servlet container does not interfere with the servlet container to which the war file is deployed. To do so, you need to mark the embedded servlet container dependency as being provided.

If you use Maven, the following example marks the servlet container (Tomcat, in this case) as being provided:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- … -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    <!-- … -->
</dependencies>
```

If you use Gradle, the following example marks the servlet container (Tomcat, in this case) as being provided:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // …
    providedRuntime 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat'
    // …
}
```

|      | `providedRuntime` is preferred to Gradle’s `compileOnly` configuration. Among other limitations, `compileOnly` dependencies are not on the test classpath, so any web-based integration tests fail. |

|      |                                                              |

If you use the [Spring Boot build tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins), marking the embedded servlet container dependency as provided produces an executable war file with the provided dependencies packaged in a `lib-provided` directory. This means that, in addition to being deployable to a servlet container, you can also run your application by using `java -jar` on the command line.

#### 9.17.2. Convert an Existing Application to Spring Boot

To convert an existing non-web Spring application to a Spring Boot application, replace the code that creates your `ApplicationContext` and replace it with calls to `SpringApplication` or `SpringApplicationBuilder`. Spring MVC web applications are generally amenable to first creating a deployable war application and then migrating it later to an executable war or jar. See the [Getting Started Guide on Converting a jar to a war](https://spring.io/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/).

To create a deployable war by extending `SpringBootServletInitializer` (for example, in a class called `Application`) and adding the Spring Boot `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, use code similar to that shown in the following example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {
        // Customize the application or call application.sources(...) to add sources
        // Since our example is itself a @Configuration class (via @SpringBootApplication)
        // we actually don't need to override this method.
        return application;
    }

}
```

Remember that, whatever you put in the `sources` is merely a Spring `ApplicationContext`. Normally, anything that already works should work here. There might be some beans you can remove later and let Spring Boot provide its own defaults for them, but it should be possible to get something working before you need to do that.

Static resources can be moved to `/public` (or `/static` or `/resources` or `/META-INF/resources`) in the classpath root. The same applies to `messages.properties` (which Spring Boot automatically detects in the root of the classpath).

Vanilla usage of Spring `DispatcherServlet` and Spring Security should require no further changes. If you have other features in your application (for instance, using other servlets or filters), you may need to add some configuration to your `Application` context, by replacing those elements from the `web.xml`, as follows:

- A `@Bean` of type `Servlet` or `ServletRegistrationBean` installs that bean in the container as if it were a `` and `` in `web.xml`.
- A `@Bean` of type `Filter` or `FilterRegistrationBean` behaves similarly (as a `` and ``).
- An `ApplicationContext` in an XML file can be added through an `@ImportResource` in your `Application`. Alternatively, cases where annotation configuration is heavily used already can be recreated in a few lines as `@Bean` definitions.

Once the war file is working, you can make it executable by adding a `main` method to your `Application`, as shown in the following example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
}
```

|      | If you intend to start your application as a war or as an executable application, you need to share the customizations of the builder in a method that is both available to the `SpringBootServletInitializer` callback and in the `main` method in a class similar to the following:`@SpringBootApplication public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {     @Override    protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder builder) {        return configureApplication(builder);    }     public static void main(String[] args) {        configureApplication(new SpringApplicationBuilder()).run(args);    }     private static SpringApplicationBuilder configureApplication(SpringApplicationBuilder builder) {        return builder.sources(Application.class).bannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF);    } }` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Applications can fall into more than one category:

- Servlet 3.0+ applications with no `web.xml`.
- Applications with a `web.xml`.
- Applications with a context hierarchy.
- Applications without a context hierarchy.

All of these should be amenable to translation, but each might require slightly different techniques.

Servlet 3.0+ applications might translate pretty easily if they already use the Spring Servlet 3.0+ initializer support classes. Normally, all the code from an existing `WebApplicationInitializer` can be moved into a `SpringBootServletInitializer`. If your existing application has more than one `ApplicationContext` (for example, if it uses `AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer`) then you might be able to combine all your context sources into a single `SpringApplication`. The main complication you might encounter is if combining does not work and you need to maintain the context hierarchy. See the [entry on building a hierarchy](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-build-an-application-context-hierarchy) for examples. An existing parent context that contains web-specific features usually needs to be broken up so that all the `ServletContextAware` components are in the child context.

Applications that are not already Spring applications might be convertible to Spring Boot applications, and the previously mentioned guidance may help. However, you may yet encounter problems. In that case, we suggest [asking questions on Stack Overflow with a tag of `spring-boot`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-boot).

#### 9.17.3. Deploying a WAR to WebLogic

To deploy a Spring Boot application to WebLogic, you must ensure that your servlet initializer **directly** implements `WebApplicationInitializer` (even if you extend from a base class that already implements it).

A typical initializer for WebLogic should resemble the following example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitializer;
import org.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializer;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {

}
```

If you use Logback, you also need to tell WebLogic to prefer the packaged version rather than the version that was pre-installed with the server. You can do so by adding a `WEB-INF/weblogic.xml` file with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<wls:weblogic-web-app
    xmlns:wls="http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
        https://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/ejb-jar_3_0.xsd
        http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app
        https://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app/1.4/weblogic-web-app.xsd">
    <wls:container-descriptor>
        <wls:prefer-application-packages>
            <wls:package-name>org.slf4j</wls:package-name>
        </wls:prefer-application-packages>
    </wls:container-descriptor>
</wls:weblogic-web-app>
```

#### 9.17.4. Use Jedis Instead of Lettuce

By default, the Spring Boot starter (`spring-boot-starter-data-redis`) uses [Lettuce](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/). You need to exclude that dependency and include the [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/) one instead. Spring Boot manages both of these dependencies so you can switch to Jedis without specifying a version.

The following example shows how to do so in Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>io.lettuce</groupId>
            <artifactId>lettuce-core</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>redis.clients</groupId>
    <artifactId>jedis</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The following example shows how to do so in Gradle:

```groovy
configurations {
    compile.exclude module: "lettuce"
}

dependencies {
    compile("redis.clients:jedis")
    // ...
}
```

### Appendix B: Configuration Metadata

Spring Boot jars include metadata files that provide details of all supported configuration properties. The files are designed to let IDE developers offer contextual help and “code completion” as users are working with `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.

The majority of the metadata file is generated automatically at compile time by processing all items annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`. However, it is possible to [write part of the metadata manually](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-additional-metadata) for corner cases or more advanced use cases.

#### 10.B.1. Metadata Format

Configuration metadata files are located inside jars under `META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json`. They use a JSON format with items categorized under either “groups” or “properties” and additional values hints categorized under "hints", as shown in the following example:

```json
{"groups": [
    {
        "name": "server",
        "type": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerProperties",
        "sourceType": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerProperties"
    },
    {
        "name": "spring.jpa.hibernate",
        "type": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.JpaProperties$Hibernate",
        "sourceType": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.JpaProperties",
        "sourceMethod": "getHibernate()"
    }
    ...
],"properties": [
    {
        "name": "server.port",
        "type": "java.lang.Integer",
        "sourceType": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerProperties"
    },
    {
        "name": "server.address",
        "type": "java.net.InetAddress",
        "sourceType": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerProperties"
    },
    {
          "name": "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto",
          "type": "java.lang.String",
          "description": "DDL mode. This is actually a shortcut for the \"hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto\" property.",
          "sourceType": "org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.JpaProperties$Hibernate"
    }
    ...
],"hints": [
    {
        "name": "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto",
        "values": [
            {
                "value": "none",
                "description": "Disable DDL handling."
            },
            {
                "value": "validate",
                "description": "Validate the schema, make no changes to the database."
            },
            {
                "value": "update",
                "description": "Update the schema if necessary."
            },
            {
                "value": "create",
                "description": "Create the schema and destroy previous data."
            },
            {
                "value": "create-drop",
                "description": "Create and then destroy the schema at the end of the session."
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

Each “property” is a configuration item that the user specifies with a given value. For example, `server.port` and `server.address` might be specified in `application.properties`, as follows:

```properties
server.port=9090
server.address=127.0.0.1
```

The “groups” are higher level items that do not themselves specify a value but instead provide a contextual grouping for properties. For example, the `server.port` and `server.address` properties are part of the `server` group.

|      | It is not required that every “property” has a “group”. Some properties might exist in their own right. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Finally, “hints” are additional information used to assist the user in configuring a given property. For example, when a developer is configuring the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` property, a tool can use the hints to offer some auto-completion help for the `none`, `validate`, `update`, `create`, and `create-drop` values.

##### Group Attributes

The JSON object contained in the `groups` array can contain the attributes shown in the following table:

| Name           | Type   | Purpose                                                      |
| :------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | String | The full name of the group. This attribute is mandatory.     |
| `type`         | String | The class name of the data type of the group. For example, if the group were based on a class annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`, the attribute would contain the fully qualified name of that class. If it were based on a `@Bean` method, it would be the return type of that method. If the type is not known, the attribute may be omitted. |
| `description`  | String | A short description of the group that can be displayed to users. If no description is available, it may be omitted. It is recommended that descriptions be short paragraphs, with the first line providing a concise summary. The last line in the description should end with a period (`.`). |
| `sourceType`   | String | The class name of the source that contributed this group. For example, if the group were based on a `@Bean` method annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`, this attribute would contain the fully qualified name of the `@Configuration` class that contains the method. If the source type is not known, the attribute may be omitted. |
| `sourceMethod` | String | The full name of the method (include parenthesis and argument types) that contributed this group (for example, the name of a `@ConfigurationProperties` annotated `@Bean` method). If the source method is not known, it may be omitted. |

##### Property Attributes

The JSON object contained in the `properties` array can contain the attributes described in the following table:

| Name           | Type        | Purpose                                                      |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | String      | The full name of the property. Names are in lower-case period-separated form (for example, `server.address`). This attribute is mandatory. |
| `type`         | String      | The full signature of the data type of the property (for example, `java.lang.String`) but also a full generic type (such as `java.util.Map`). You can use this attribute to guide the user as to the types of values that they can enter. For consistency, the type of a primitive is specified by using its wrapper counterpart (for example, `boolean` becomes `java.lang.Boolean`). Note that this class may be a complex type that gets converted from a `String` as values are bound. If the type is not known, it may be omitted. |
| `description`  | String      | A short description of the property that can be displayed to users. If no description is available, it may be omitted. It is recommended that descriptions be short paragraphs, with the first line providing a concise summary. The last line in the description should end with a period (`.`). |
| `sourceType`   | String      | The class name of the source that contributed this property. For example, if the property were from a class annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`, this attribute would contain the fully qualified name of that class. If the source type is unknown, it may be omitted. |
| `defaultValue` | Object      | The default value, which is used if the property is not specified. If the type of the property is an array, it can be an array of value(s). If the default value is unknown, it may be omitted. |
| `deprecation`  | Deprecation | Specify whether the property is deprecated. If the field is not deprecated or if that information is not known, it may be omitted. The next table offers more detail about the `deprecation` attribute. |

The JSON object contained in the `deprecation` attribute of each `properties` element can contain the following attributes:

| Name          | Type   | Purpose                                                      |
| :------------ | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `level`       | String | The level of deprecation, which can be either `warning` (the default) or `error`. When a property has a `warning` deprecation level, it should still be bound in the environment. However, when it has an `error` deprecation level, the property is no longer managed and is not bound. |
| `reason`      | String | A short description of the reason why the property was deprecated. If no reason is available, it may be omitted. It is recommended that descriptions be short paragraphs, with the first line providing a concise summary. The last line in the description should end with a period (`.`). |
| `replacement` | String | The full name of the property that *replaces* this deprecated property. If there is no replacement for this property, it may be omitted. |

|      | Prior to Spring Boot 1.3, a single `deprecated` boolean attribute can be used instead of the `deprecation` element. This is still supported in a deprecated fashion and should no longer be used. If no reason and replacement are available, an empty `deprecation` object should be set. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

Deprecation can also be specified declaratively in code by adding the `@DeprecatedConfigurationProperty` annotation to the getter exposing the deprecated property. For instance, assume that the `app.acme.target` property was confusing and was renamed to `app.acme.name`. The following example shows how to handle that situation:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("app.acme")
public class AcmeProperties {

    private String name;

    public String getName() { ... }

    public void setName(String name) { ... }

    @DeprecatedConfigurationProperty(replacement = "app.acme.name")
    @Deprecated
    public String getTarget() {
        return getName();
    }

    @Deprecated
    public void setTarget(String target) {
        setName(target);
    }
}
```

|      | There is no way to set a `level`. `warning` is always assumed, since code is still handling the property. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The preceding code makes sure that the deprecated property still works (delegating to the `name` property behind the scenes). Once the `getTarget` and `setTarget` methods can be removed from your public API, the automatic deprecation hint in the metadata goes away as well. If you want to keep a hint, adding manual metadata with an `error` deprecation level ensures that users are still informed about that property. Doing so is particularly useful when a `replacement` is provided.

##### Hint Attributes

The JSON object contained in the `hints` array can contain the attributes shown in the following table:

| Name        | Type            | Purpose                                                      |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | String          | The full name of the property to which this hint refers. Names are in lower-case period-separated form (such as `spring.mvc.servlet.path`). If the property refers to a map (such as `system.contexts`), the hint either applies to the *keys* of the map (`system.contexts.keys`) or the *values* (`system.contexts.values`) of the map. This attribute is mandatory. |
| `values`    | ValueHint[]     | A list of valid values as defined by the `ValueHint` object (described in the next table). Each entry defines the value and may have a description. |
| `providers` | ValueProvider[] | A list of providers as defined by the `ValueProvider` object (described later in this document). Each entry defines the name of the provider and its parameters, if any. |

The JSON object contained in the `values` attribute of each `hint` element can contain the attributes described in the following table:

| Name          | Type   | Purpose                                                      |
| :------------ | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`       | Object | A valid value for the element to which the hint refers. If the type of the property is an array, it can also be an array of value(s). This attribute is mandatory. |
| `description` | String | A short description of the value that can be displayed to users. If no description is available, it may be omitted. It is recommended that descriptions be short paragraphs, with the first line providing a concise summary. The last line in the description should end with a period (`.`). |

The JSON object contained in the `providers` attribute of each `hint` element can contain the attributes described in the following table:

| Name         | Type        | Purpose                                                      |
| :----------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | String      | The name of the provider to use to offer additional content assistance for the element to which the hint refers. |
| `parameters` | JSON object | Any additional parameter that the provider supports (check the documentation of the provider for more details). |

##### Repeated Metadata Items

Objects with the same “property” and “group” name can appear multiple times within a metadata file. For example, you could bind two separate classes to the same prefix, with each having potentially overlapping property names. While the same names appearing in the metadata multiple times should not be common, consumers of metadata should take care to ensure that they support it.

#### 10.B.2. Providing Manual Hints

To improve the user experience and further assist the user in configuring a given property, you can provide additional metadata that:

- Describes the list of potential values for a property.
- Associates a provider, to attach a well defined semantic to a property, so that a tool can discover the list of potential values based on the project’s context.

##### Value Hint

The `name` attribute of each hint refers to the `name` of a property. In the [initial example shown earlier](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-format), we provide five values for the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` property: `none`, `validate`, `update`, `create`, and `create-drop`. Each value may have a description as well.

If your property is of type `Map`, you can provide hints for both the keys and the values (but not for the map itself). The special `.keys` and `.values` suffixes must refer to the keys and the values, respectively.

Assume a `sample.contexts` maps magic `String` values to an integer, as shown in the following example:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties("sample")
public class SampleProperties {

    private Map<String,Integer> contexts;
    // getters and setters
}
```

The magic values are (in this example) are `sample1` and `sample2`. In order to offer additional content assistance for the keys, you could add the following JSON to [the manual metadata of the module](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-additional-metadata):

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "sample.contexts.keys",
        "values": [
            {
                "value": "sample1"
            },
            {
                "value": "sample2"
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

|      | We recommend that you use an `Enum` for those two values instead. If your IDE supports it, this is by far the most effective approach to auto-completion. |

|      |                                                              |

##### Value Providers

Providers are a powerful way to attach semantics to a property. In this section, we define the official providers that you can use for your own hints. However, your favorite IDE may implement some of these or none of them. Also, it could eventually provide its own.

|      | As this is a new feature, IDE vendors must catch up with how it works. Adoption times naturally vary. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following table summarizes the list of supported providers:

| Name                    | Description                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `any`                   | Permits any additional value to be provided.                 |
| `class-reference`       | Auto-completes the classes available in the project. Usually constrained by a base class that is specified by the `target` parameter. |
| `handle-as`             | Handles the property as if it were defined by the type defined by the mandatory `target` parameter. |
| `logger-name`           | Auto-completes valid logger names and [logger groups](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-log-groups). Typically, package and class names available in the current project can be auto-completed as well as defined groups. |
| `spring-bean-reference` | Auto-completes the available bean names in the current project. Usually constrained by a base class that is specified by the `target` parameter. |
| `spring-profile-name`   | Auto-completes the available Spring profile names in the project. |

|      | Only one provider can be active for a given property, but you can specify several providers if they can all manage the property *in some way*. Make sure to place the most powerful provider first, as the IDE must use the first one in the JSON section that it can handle. If no provider for a given property is supported, no special content assistance is provided, either. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Any

The special **any** provider value permits any additional values to be provided. Regular value validation based on the property type should be applied if this is supported.

This provider is typically used if you have a list of values and any extra values should still be considered as valid.

The following example offers `on` and `off` as auto-completion values for `system.state`:

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "system.state",
        "values": [
            {
                "value": "on"
            },
            {
                "value": "off"
            }
        ],
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "any"
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

Note that, in the preceding example, any other value is also allowed.

###### Class Reference

The **class-reference** provider auto-completes classes available in the project. This provider supports the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Type               | Default value | Description                                                  |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target`   | `String` (`Class`) | *none*        | The fully qualified name of the class that should be assignable to the chosen value. Typically used to filter out-non candidate classes. Note that this information can be provided by the type itself by exposing a class with the appropriate upper bound. |
| `concrete` | `boolean`          | true          | Specify whether only concrete classes are to be considered as valid candidates. |

The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard `server.servlet.jsp.class-name` property that defines the `JspServlet` class name to use:

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "server.servlet.jsp.class-name",
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "class-reference",
                "parameters": {
                    "target": "javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

###### Handle As

The **handle-as** provider lets you substitute the type of the property to a more high-level type. This typically happens when the property has a `java.lang.String` type, because you do not want your configuration classes to rely on classes that may not be on the classpath. This provider supports the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Type               | Default value | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`target`** | `String` (`Class`) | *none*        | The fully qualified name of the type to consider for the property. This parameter is mandatory. |

The following types can be used:

- Any `java.lang.Enum`: Lists the possible values for the property. (We recommend defining the property with the `Enum` type, as no further hint should be required for the IDE to auto-complete the values)
- `java.nio.charset.Charset`: Supports auto-completion of charset/encoding values (such as `UTF-8`)
- `java.util.Locale`: auto-completion of locales (such as `en_US`)
- `org.springframework.util.MimeType`: Supports auto-completion of content type values (such as `text/plain`)
- `org.springframework.core.io.Resource`: Supports auto-completion of Spring’s Resource abstraction to refer to a file on the filesystem or on the classpath (such as `classpath:/sample.properties`)

|      | If multiple values can be provided, use a `Collection` or *Array* type to teach the IDE about it. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard `spring.liquibase.change-log` property that defines the path to the changelog to use. It is actually used internally as a `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` but cannot be exposed as such, because we need to keep the original String value to pass it to the Liquibase API.

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "spring.liquibase.change-log",
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "handle-as",
                "parameters": {
                    "target": "org.springframework.core.io.Resource"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

###### Logger Name

The **logger-name** provider auto-completes valid logger names and [logger groups](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-log-groups). Typically, package and class names available in the current project can be auto-completed. If groups are enabled (default) and if a custom logger group is identified in the configuration, auto-completion for it should be provided. Specific frameworks may have extra magic logger names that can be supported as well.

This provider supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type      | Default value | Description                                        |
| :-------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `group`   | `boolean` | `true`        | Specify whether known groups should be considered. |

Since a logger name can be any arbitrary name, this provider should allow any value but could highlight valid package and class names that are not available in the project’s classpath.

The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard `logging.level` property. Keys are *logger names*, and values correspond to the standard log levels or any custom level. As Spring Boot defines a few logger groups out-of-the-box, dedicated value hints have been added for those.

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "logging.level.keys",
        "values": [
            {
                "value": "root",
                "description": "Root logger used to assign the default logging level."
            },
            {
                "value": "sql",
                "description": "SQL logging group including Hibernate SQL logger."
            },
            {
                "value": "web",
                "description": "Web logging group including codecs."
            }
        ],
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "logger-name"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "logging.level.values",
        "values": [
            {
                "value": "trace"
            },
            {
                "value": "debug"
            },
            {
                "value": "info"
            },
            {
                "value": "warn"
            },
            {
                "value": "error"
            },
            {
                "value": "fatal"
            },
            {
                "value": "off"
            }

        ],
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "any"
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

###### Spring Bean Reference

The **spring-bean-reference** provider auto-completes the beans that are defined in the configuration of the current project. This provider supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type               | Default value | Description                                                  |
| :-------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target`  | `String` (`Class`) | *none*        | The fully qualified name of the bean class that should be assignable to the candidate. Typically used to filter out non-candidate beans. |

The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard `spring.jmx.server` property that defines the name of the `MBeanServer` bean to use:

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "spring.jmx.server",
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "spring-bean-reference",
                "parameters": {
                    "target": "javax.management.MBeanServer"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

|      | The binder is not aware of the metadata. If you provide that hint, you still need to transform the bean name into an actual Bean reference using by the `ApplicationContext`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

###### Spring Profile Name

The **spring-profile-name** provider auto-completes the Spring profiles that are defined in the configuration of the current project.

The following metadata snippet corresponds to the standard `spring.profiles.active` property that defines the name of the Spring profile(s) to enable:

```json
{"hints": [
    {
        "name": "spring.profiles.active",
        "providers": [
            {
                "name": "spring-profile-name"
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

#### 10.B.3. Generating Your Own Metadata by Using the Annotation Processor

You can easily generate your own configuration metadata file from items annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` by using the `spring-boot-configuration-processor` jar. The jar includes a Java annotation processor which is invoked as your project is compiled. To use the processor, include a dependency on `spring-boot-configuration-processor`.

With Maven the dependency should be declared as optional, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-configuration-processor</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

If you have defined `@ConfigurationProperties` in your application, make sure to configure the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` to prevent the `repackage` goal from adding the dependency into the fat jar:

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <excludes>
                        <exclude>
                            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                            <artifactId>spring-boot-configuration-processor</artifactId>
                        </exclude>
                    </excludes>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

With Gradle 4.5 and earlier, the dependency should be declared in the `compileOnly` configuration, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-configuration-processor"
}
```

With Gradle 4.6 and later, the dependency should be declared in the `annotationProcessor` configuration, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    annotationProcessor "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-configuration-processor"
}
```

If you are using an `additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json` file, the `compileJava` task should be configured to depend on the `processResources` task, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
compileJava.inputs.files(processResources)
```

This dependency ensures that the additional metadata is available when the annotation processor runs during compilation.

The processor picks up both classes and methods that are annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`. The Javadoc for field values within configuration classes is used to populate the `description` attribute.

|      | You should only use plain text with `@ConfigurationProperties` field Javadoc, since they are not processed before being added to the JSON. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

If the class has a single constructor with at least one parameters, one property is created per constructor parameter. Otherwise, properties are discovered through the presence of standard getters and setters with special handling for collection types (that is detected even if only a getter is present).

The annotation processor also supports the use of the `@Data`, `@Getter`, and `@Setter` lombok annotations.

The annotation processor cannot auto-detect default values for `Enum`s and `Collections`s. In the cases where a `Collection` or `Enum` property has a non-empty default value, [manual metadata](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-additional-metadata) should be provided.

Consider the following class:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "acme.messaging")
public class MessagingProperties {

    private List<String> addresses = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b"));

    private ContainerType containerType = ContainerType.SIMPLE;

    // ... getter and setters

    public enum ContainerType {

        SIMPLE,
        DIRECT

    }

}
```

In order to document default values for properties in the class above, you could add the following content to [the manual metadata of the module](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata-additional-metadata):

```json
{"properties": [
    {
        "name": "acme.messaging.addresses",
        "defaultValue": ["a", "b"]
    },
    {
        "name": "acme.messaging.container-type",
        "defaultValue": "simple"
    }
]}
```

Only the `name` of the property is required to document additional fields with manual metadata.

|      | If you are using AspectJ in your project, you need to make sure that the annotation processor runs only once. There are several ways to do this. With Maven, you can configure the `maven-apt-plugin` explicitly and add the dependency to the annotation processor only there. You could also let the AspectJ plugin run all the processing and disable annotation processing in the `maven-compiler-plugin` configuration, as follows:`    org.apache.maven.plugins    maven-compiler-plugin            none     ` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Nested Properties

The annotation processor automatically considers inner classes as nested properties. Consider the following class:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="server")
public class ServerProperties {

    private String name;

    private Host host;

    // ... getter and setters

    public static class Host {

        private String ip;

        private int port;

        // ... getter and setters

    }

}
```

The preceding example produces metadata information for `server.name`, `server.host.ip`, and `server.host.port` properties. You can use the `@NestedConfigurationProperty` annotation on a field to indicate that a regular (non-inner) class should be treated as if it were nested.

|      | This has no effect on collections and maps, as those types are automatically identified, and a single metadata property is generated for each of them. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

##### Adding Additional Metadata

Spring Boot’s configuration file handling is quite flexible, and it is often the case that properties may exist that are not bound to a `@ConfigurationProperties` bean. You may also need to tune some attributes of an existing key. To support such cases and let you provide custom "hints", the annotation processor automatically merges items from `META-INF/additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json` into the main metadata file.

If you refer to a property that has been detected automatically, the description, default value, and deprecation information are overridden, if specified. If the manual property declaration is not identified in the current module, it is added as a new property.

The format of the `additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json` file is exactly the same as the regular `spring-configuration-metadata.json`. The additional properties file is optional. If you do not have any additional properties, do not add the file.

### Appendix C: Auto-configuration Classes

This appendix contains details of all of the auto-configuration classes provided by Spring Boot, with links to documentation and source code. Remember to also look at the conditions report in your application for more details of which features are switched on. (To do so, start the app with `--debug` or `-Ddebug` or, in an Actuator application, use the `conditions` endpoint).

#### 10.C.1. `spring-boot-autoconfigure`

The following auto-configuration classes are from the `spring-boot-autoconfigure` module:

### Appendix E: The Executable Jar Format

The `spring-boot-loader` modules lets Spring Boot support executable jar and war files. If you use the Maven plugin or the Gradle plugin, executable jars are automatically generated, and you generally do not need to know the details of how they work.

If you need to create executable jars from a different build system or if you are just curious about the underlying technology, this appendix provides some background.

#### 10.E.1. Nested JARs

Java does not provide any standard way to load nested jar files (that is, jar files that are themselves contained within a jar). This can be problematic if you need to distribute a self-contained application that can be run from the command line without unpacking.

To solve this problem, many developers use “shaded” jars. A shaded jar packages all classes, from all jars, into a single “uber jar”. The problem with shaded jars is that it becomes hard to see which libraries are actually in your application. It can also be problematic if the same filename is used (but with different content) in multiple jars. Spring Boot takes a different approach and lets you actually nest jars directly.

##### The Executable Jar File Structure

Spring Boot Loader-compatible jar files should be structured in the following way:

```
example.jar
 |
 +-META-INF
 |  +-MANIFEST.MF
 +-org
 |  +-springframework
 |     +-boot
 |        +-loader
 |           +-<spring boot loader classes>
 +-BOOT-INF
    +-classes
    |  +-mycompany
    |     +-project
    |        +-YourClasses.class
    +-lib
       +-dependency1.jar
       +-dependency2.jar
```

Application classes should be placed in a nested `BOOT-INF/classes` directory. Dependencies should be placed in a nested `BOOT-INF/lib` directory.

##### The Executable War File Structure

Spring Boot Loader-compatible war files should be structured in the following way:

```
example.war
 |
 +-META-INF
 |  +-MANIFEST.MF
 +-org
 |  +-springframework
 |     +-boot
 |        +-loader
 |           +-<spring boot loader classes>
 +-WEB-INF
    +-classes
    |  +-com
    |     +-mycompany
    |        +-project
    |           +-YourClasses.class
    +-lib
    |  +-dependency1.jar
    |  +-dependency2.jar
    +-lib-provided
       +-servlet-api.jar
       +-dependency3.jar
```

Dependencies should be placed in a nested `WEB-INF/lib` directory. Any dependencies that are required when running embedded but are not required when deploying to a traditional web container should be placed in `WEB-INF/lib-provided`.

#### 10.E.2. Spring Boot’s “JarFile” Class

The core class used to support loading nested jars is `org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile`. It lets you load jar content from a standard jar file or from nested child jar data. When first loaded, the location of each `JarEntry` is mapped to a physical file offset of the outer jar, as shown in the following example:

```
myapp.jar
+-------------------+-------------------------+
| /BOOT-INF/classes | /BOOT-INF/lib/mylib.jar |
|+-----------------+||+-----------+----------+|
||     A.class      |||  B.class  |  C.class ||
|+-----------------+||+-----------+----------+|
+-------------------+-------------------------+
 ^                    ^           ^
 0063                 3452        3980
```

The preceding example shows how `A.class` can be found in `/BOOT-INF/classes` in `myapp.jar` at position `0063`. `B.class` from the nested jar can actually be found in `myapp.jar` at position `3452`, and `C.class` is at position `3980`.

Armed with this information, we can load specific nested entries by seeking to the appropriate part of the outer jar. We do not need to unpack the archive, and we do not need to read all entry data into memory.

##### Compatibility with the Standard Java “JarFile”

Spring Boot Loader strives to remain compatible with existing code and libraries. `org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile` extends from `java.util.jar.JarFile` and should work as a drop-in replacement. The `getURL()` method returns a `URL` that opens a connection compatible with `java.net.JarURLConnection` and can be used with Java’s `URLClassLoader`.

#### 10.E.3. Launching Executable Jars

The `org.springframework.boot.loader.Launcher` class is a special bootstrap class that is used as an executable jar’s main entry point. It is the actual `Main-Class` in your jar file, and it is used to setup an appropriate `URLClassLoader` and ultimately call your `main()` method.

There are three launcher subclasses (`JarLauncher`, `WarLauncher`, and `PropertiesLauncher`). Their purpose is to load resources (`.class` files and so on) from nested jar files or war files in directories (as opposed to those explicitly on the classpath). In the case of `JarLauncher` and `WarLauncher`, the nested paths are fixed. `JarLauncher` looks in `BOOT-INF/lib/`, and `WarLauncher` looks in `WEB-INF/lib/` and `WEB-INF/lib-provided/`. You can add extra jars in those locations if you want more. The `PropertiesLauncher` looks in `BOOT-INF/lib/` in your application archive by default. You can add additional locations by setting an environment variable called `LOADER_PATH` or `loader.path` in `loader.properties` (which is a comma-separated list of directories, archives, or directories within archives).

##### Launcher Manifest

You need to specify an appropriate `Launcher` as the `Main-Class` attribute of `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`. The actual class that you want to launch (that is, the class that contains a `main` method) should be specified in the `Start-Class` attribute.

The following example shows a typical `MANIFEST.MF` for an executable jar file:

```
Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
Start-Class: com.mycompany.project.MyApplication
```

For a war file, it would be as follows:

```
Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.WarLauncher
Start-Class: com.mycompany.project.MyApplication
```

|      | You need not specify `Class-Path` entries in your manifest file. The classpath is deduced from the nested jars. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

#### 10.E.4. `PropertiesLauncher` Features

`PropertiesLauncher` has a few special features that can be enabled with external properties (System properties, environment variables, manifest entries, or `loader.properties`). The following table describes these properties:

| Key                      | Purpose                                                      |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loader.path`            | Comma-separated Classpath, such as `lib,${HOME}/app/lib`. Earlier entries take precedence, like a regular `-classpath` on the `javac` command line. |
| `loader.home`            | Used to resolve relative paths in `loader.path`. For example, given `loader.path=lib`, then `${loader.home}/lib` is a classpath location (along with all jar files in that directory). This property is also used to locate a `loader.properties` file, as in the following example `/opt/app` It defaults to `${user.dir}`. |
| `loader.args`            | Default arguments for the main method (space separated).     |
| `loader.main`            | Name of main class to launch (for example, `com.app.Application`). |
| `loader.config.name`     | Name of properties file (for example, `launcher`). It defaults to `loader`. |
| `loader.config.location` | Path to properties file (for example, `classpath:loader.properties`). It defaults to `loader.properties`. |
| `loader.system`          | Boolean flag to indicate that all properties should be added to System properties. It defaults to `false`. |

When specified as environment variables or manifest entries, the following names should be used:

| Key                      | Manifest entry           | Environment variable     |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `loader.path`            | `Loader-Path`            | `LOADER_PATH`            |
| `loader.home`            | `Loader-Home`            | `LOADER_HOME`            |
| `loader.args`            | `Loader-Args`            | `LOADER_ARGS`            |
| `loader.main`            | `Start-Class`            | `LOADER_MAIN`            |
| `loader.config.location` | `Loader-Config-Location` | `LOADER_CONFIG_LOCATION` |
| `loader.system`          | `Loader-System`          | `LOADER_SYSTEM`          |

|      | Build plugins automatically move the `Main-Class` attribute to `Start-Class` when the fat jar is built. If you use that, specify the name of the class to launch by using the `Main-Class` attribute and leaving out `Start-Class`. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                                              |

The following rules apply to working with `PropertiesLauncher`:

- `loader.properties` is searched for in `loader.home`, then in the root of the classpath, and then in `classpath:/BOOT-INF/classes`. The first location where a file with that name exists is used.
- `loader.home` is the directory location of an additional properties file (overriding the default) only when `loader.config.location` is not specified.
- `loader.path` can contain directories (which are scanned recursively for jar and zip files), archive paths, a directory within an archive that is scanned for jar files (for example, `dependencies.jar!/lib`), or wildcard patterns (for the default JVM behavior). Archive paths can be relative to `loader.home` or anywhere in the file system with a `jar:file:` prefix.
- `loader.path` (if empty) defaults to `BOOT-INF/lib` (meaning a local directory or a nested one if running from an archive). Because of this, `PropertiesLauncher` behaves the same as `JarLauncher` when no additional configuration is provided.
- `loader.path` can not be used to configure the location of `loader.properties` (the classpath used to search for the latter is the JVM classpath when `PropertiesLauncher` is launched).
- Placeholder replacement is done from System and environment variables plus the properties file itself on all values before use.
- The search order for properties (where it makes sense to look in more than one place) is environment variables, system properties, `loader.properties`, the exploded archive manifest, and the archive manifest.

#### 10.E.5. Executable Jar Restrictions

You need to consider the following restrictions when working with a Spring Boot Loader packaged application:

- Zip entry compression: The `ZipEntry` for a nested jar must be saved by using the `ZipEntry.STORED` method. This is required so that we can seek directly to individual content within the nested jar. The content of the nested jar file itself can still be compressed, as can any other entries in the outer jar.

- System classLoader: Launched applications should use `Thread.getContextClassLoader()` when loading classes (most libraries and frameworks do so by default). Trying to load nested jar classes with `ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()` fails. `java.util.Logging` always uses the system classloader. For this reason, you should consider a different logging implementation.

#### 10.E.6. Alternative Single Jar Solutions

If the preceding restrictions mean that you cannot use Spring Boot Loader, consider the following alternatives:

- [Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
- [JarClassLoader](http://www.jdotsoft.com/JarClassLoader.php)
- [OneJar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/one-jar/)
- [Gradle Shadow Plugin](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/)

### Appendix F: Dependency versions

This appendix provides details of the dependencies that are managed by Spring Boot.

#### 10.F.1. Managed Dependency Coordinates

The following table provides details of all of the dependency versions that are provided by Spring Boot in its CLI (Command Line Interface), Maven dependency management, and Gradle plugin. When you declare a dependency on one of these artifacts without declaring a version, the version listed in the table is used.
